The Company began reviewing adquisitions in late 2008 and in\nlate 2009 signed its first Letter of Intent to acquire the Fredonia Project.\n\nFredonia was the first acquisition among several projects the Company has been evaluating in\nthe gold-rich 300 kilometer long Middle Cauca Belt - the acquisition provides Colombia Crest\nwith a significant land position in a largely unexplored portion of a world-class porphyry gold\nbelt with gold production dating back 500 years. Under the Fredonia Agreement with Grupo de\nBullet SA, Colombia Crest retains the rights to explore 15 concessions, which includes 10\nTechnical Studies and five Contracts, covering approximately 25,731 hectares. Pursuant to an\nagreement dated August 13, 2010 and amended August 16, 2011, the Company can acquire a\n75% interest in the Fredonia property.\n\nThe second acquisition, Venecia property, is owned by Colombian Mines Corporation and\nlocated within the Fredonia project area, close to the town of Venecia, Colombia. It adjoins the\nwestern edge of the La Mina property, where Bellhaven Copper and Gold Inc. currently have a\ngold resource. Pursuant to an Earn-In Agreement with Colombian Mines Corporation, dated\nMarch 30, 2011, Colombia Crest has an option to acquire up to a 75% interest in the mineral\ntitle of the 1,992 hectare Venecia property.\n\nWithin the Fredonia and Venecia areas, there has been relatively little historic gold exploration,\nwith the majority of gold production being from alluvial deposits. Some hard rock mining was\nconducted at the site of B2Gold\u2019s (now Bellhaven Copper and Gold) La Mina property,\nimmediately adjacent to the Venecia prospect. The Venecia prospect was acquired by\nColombia Mines because of its proximity to the known La Mina deposits on the adjacent\nproperty of Bellhaven. To the south of the project area AngloGold Ashanti is drilling the\nQuebradona porphyry-style prospect, and to the north, Sunward Resources is advancing the 11-\nmillion ounce Titiribi Project towards feasibility.\n\nLike other porphyry targets of the region the geology of the Venecia and Fredonia areas is\ndominated by Tertiary age, hypabissal andesite to dacite porphyritic rocks and intrusive rocks\n(diorite and granodiorite). These stocks and smaller apophasis of these rocks intrude and\nmineralize volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic age Ca\u00f1as Gordas Group older portions\nof Combia Formation on the property. At the Arabia zone, in the bottom of Arabia Creek, the\ntop of a stock of magnetite and sulfide-bearing diorite porphyry hosts the porphyry-style gold in\npotassically altered rocks. This relationship was discovered in drilling. The upper members of\nthe Combia Formation cover most of the earlier rocks and may post date the intrusive /\nmineralizing events.\n\n\nDr. Thomas A.

The city\u2019s international airport provides direct\naccess to Miami, New York, Lima, Caracas, Quito and Panama City, as well as the majority of\nColombia\u2019s regional centers including the capital Bogot\u00e1. Access to the property from Medell\u00edn\nis by paved roads to the municipal centers of Caldas, Fredonia and Venecia, and from there by\nsecondary and tertiary (unpaved) roads of variable quality connecting smaller populations and\nrural areas.\n\nThe property is contained within and adjacent to the Cauca-Patia or Inter-Andean physiographic\nprovince which lies between the Central and Western Cordillera. As such it is located in steep,\nmountainous and relatively rugged terrain at elevations ranging from 600 to 2,500 meters\nabove sea level. The climate of the region varies with altitude. For example, in the town of\nFredonia (1,800 meters above sea level) the average temperature is 20\u00b0C, whereas at lower\naltitudes in the Cauca valley, the average temperature is 25\u00b0C or greater. Two rainy seasons\ngenerally occur in October-November and April-May. Average annual precipitation is variable\ndepending on location, but can be greater than 3,000 mm. Exploration and mining activities\ncan be conducted year-round.\n\nThe property area has fairly well-developed infrastructure and a local work force familiar with\nbasic mining operations. The town of Fredonia has a population of 8,576 (DANE Census 2005)\nwith an additional 14,005 people living within the municipal boundary. Approximately eight\nkilometers to the northwest, the town of Venecia is slightly smaller with a population of 6,212\nDr. Thomas A.

The project area is served by the\nnational electrical power grid. Land telephone lines are restricted to the urban centers, with\ncellular telephone reception available throughout wide parts of the project area. Other than\nlocally available basic supplies, most provisions and equipment must be obtained in Medell\u00edn.\nPotential sites for mining infrastructure such as tailings disposal, waste dumps, heap leach pads\nand plant sites will be dependent upon where economic deposits will be discovered in the\nfuture.\n\nVegetation in the area of the property is mixed scrub brush and forest with the flora depending\nmainly on the altitude. Agriculture and livestock pasturing, particularly coffee plantations, are\nthe principal economic activities in the area. Tourism and second homes are becoming\nincreasingly important assets to the region, due to its close proximity to Medellin.\n\n\n6.0 HISTORY\nThe Antioquia district of Colombia, in which the Fredonia and Venecia prospects are located,\nhas been a source of gold mining that goes back several centuries to pre\u2010Colombian times.\nSmall\u2010scale artisanal mining, some from hard\u2010rock sources and some from alluvial deposits,\nwere common throughout the district and so \u201cpirqui\u00f1ero\u201d prospectors were likely active\nthroughout the Central Cordillera district on either flank of the River Cauca.\n\nColombia was once the largest historical gold producer of the Spanish empire and in South\nAmerica. Gold production between 1514 and 1934 is estimated at 49 million ounces, 38% of the\ntotal production for South America. Subsequent production is estimated at 30 million ounces,\nwhich gives Colombia a total recorded historical gold production of approximately 80 million\nounces. Seventy-five percent of this production came from the Departments of Antioquia and\nCaldas.\n\nGold production in 2008 was just over one million ounces as a result of the almost complete\nabsence of modern exploration practices before 2003. In the early 2000s, AngloGold Ashanti\ncarried out broad\u2010scale geochemical and other exploration programs throughout this district of\nColombia and was responsible for the initial discovery of copper-gold mineralization on surface\nat the La Cantera outcrop on the nearby La Mina prospect. Since this time, the new Mining\nCode (introduced in 2001) and in particular the policies of the current Colombian government,\nheaded by former President Alvaro Uribe, have resulted in a veritable gold-rush into Colombia\nby international exploration and mining companies taking advantage of the improved security\nsituation and unexplored potential that the country has to offer. This has also resulted in a\nnumber of recent major new gold discoveries, distributed across the three separate mountain\nranges that make up the Andean Cordillera in Colombia.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                               10\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n\n        6.1 Fredonia and Venecia Prospects\nThe principal historic and indeed modern day mining activity in the area of the Fredonia project\nhas been concentrated on the exploitation of thermal coal in small underground mines. This\nactivity began more than 150 years ago at the time when Medellin began to establish itself,\nbased on the availability of this coal and the discovery of gold in the nearby Titiribi district. In\nthe majority of the coal mines, little much has changed since these times, although there are\nnow a number of larger more organized companies, operating mines that employ up to 300\npeople.\n\nWithin the project area, there has been relatively little historic gold exploration, with the\nmajority being alluvial gold recovered from creeks. Some hard rock mining was conducted at\nthe site of B2Gold\u2019s (now Bellhaven) La Mina property, immediately adjacent to the Venecia\nprospect. The Venecia prospect was acquired by Colombia Mines because of the porphyry-style\ngold on the prospect and its proximity to the known La Mina deposits on the adjacent property\nof Bellhaven.\n\nIn the western portion of the project area, in the Titiribi District, which is currently being\npartially explored by Sunward Resources, total gold production has been estimated at 1.5 to 2.0\nmillion ounces of gold equivalent (Emmons, 1937). Mining in the Titiribi District has taken place\nsince 1793 and during the 1800s and early 1900s, production of polymetallic ores containing\ngold, silver, zinc, lead, copper, antimony, and arsenic from at least 14 mines near Titiribi. The\nlargest production was from El Zancudo Mine where production of 129,325 ounces of gold and\n958,570 ounces of silver were reported (Kantor and Cameron, 2011).\n\nThe area has seen little modern exploration or development due to previous security concerns,\nleaving much of its potential to be realized. This potential is today being confirmed by\ndiscoveries to the north, east, and south of the JV areas.\n\n\n\n7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING\n\n        7.1 Regional Geology\n\nThe Colombian Cordillera comprises three separate mountain ranges underlain by a series of\nmagmatic arcs that were emplaced along the western margin of South America from Jurassic\nthrough Miocene time (Fig. 5). Subduction along an Andean-type continental margin during the\nJurassic gave way to accretion of allochthonous island-arc terrains in the Cretaceous and\nTertiary. The predominantly calc-alkaline affinity of the subduction-related magmatism\nthroughout this period coupled with the complex poly-phase compressional structural regime\ncreated a favorable metallogenic setting for large gold deposits. The project is located\nstraddling the Cauca-Patia Depression, including parts of both the Western and Central\nCordillera. Situated within the regional, north south trending Cauca \u2013 Romeral belt, the Venecia\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                 11\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\nprospect is one of several gold \u2013 copper porphyry systems along the Colombian portion of the\nAndean Porphyry Belt which extends through Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and into northern Colombia.\nLocated just north the Marmato mining district in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia, the\nCompany believes Venecia hosts multi-million ounce target potential for bulk mineable\nporphyry style mineralization and may host high grade structurally controlled mineralization\nsuitable for more selective underground mining techniques.\n\nThe regional geology is summarized below.\n\n                7.1.1 The Western Cordillera\n\nDominated by thick sequences of Cretaceous flyschoid volcanic and sedimentary strata,\nintruded by Early and Late Cenozoic plutonic and hypabyssal intrusive rocks, recent\ninterpretations of the evolution of the Western Cordillera of the Northern Andes involve the\nassembly and accretion of Cretaceous oceanic terrains to the western margin of continental\nSouth America, beginning in the Late Cretaceous. The Western Cordillera may be considered in\ntwo segments; a southern segment consisting of at least three distinct accreted Cretaceous\noceanic terrains, and a northern segment comprised of the Choco Segment of the Panama Arc,\ncontaining the Baud\u00f3 and Ca\u00f1as Gordas Terraines.\n\nMagmatic activity in the north is dominated by the Eocene Mand\u00e9-Acand\u00ed, Farallones, and\nMistrato Batholiths, of calc-alkalic affinity and generally tonalitic composition. They demarcate\nthe formation of island arcs constructed upon oceanic crust prior to it\u2019s collision with northern\nColombia in the Neogene. Magmatism in the southern segment is volumetrically more\nrestricted, manifesting as Eocene tonalite plutons in the southern central Western Cordillera\n(Piedrancha Batholith), and widely dispersed but small diorite/granodiorite porphyry bodies of\nNeogene age.\n\n                7.1.2 The Cauca-Patia Depression (Inter-Andean Depression)\n\nThis important geologic \u2013 geographic intermontane depression separates the Central and\nWestern Cordilleras of Colombia and includes the complex Cauca-Romeral fault zone which\nrepresents the (Cretaceous) suture zone between the Paleozoic meta-sedimentary rocks of the\ncontinental basement to the east and an accreted, Cretaceous age, oceanic crust-island arc\nsequence to the west. The Depression records clastic shallow marine and intermontane\nsedimentation and volcanism beginning in the Eocene. It is an important feature from a\nmetallogenic standpoint as it became the locus for eastward migrating magmatic activity\nbeginning in the Oligocene \u2013 Miocene, due to the reactivation of the Romeral Fault Zone, and\nhosts numerous hypabyssal porphyry intrusions of dioritic to granodioritic composition, related\nto the area\u2019s gold mineralization, which intrude a generally reduced Palaeozoic metamorphic\nbasement, and unconformably overlying Paleogene clastic sedimentary and volcanic sequences\n(Amaga and Combia Formations), which occur along its entire length.\n\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                12\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\nRecent analysis of seismic reflection profiles indicates the Paleozoic basement, and clastic\nsedimentary sequences in the southern portion of the Depression underwent thrust-and fold-\nbelt style deformation both prior to and following hypabyssal porphyry intrusion. A general\nthree phase history for the Cauca-Patia Depression may thus be inferred:\n    1) as a coastal margin \u2013 intermontane basin receiving clastic sedimentation from the\n        emerging Central and Western Cordilleras;\n    2) as a zone of foreland compression, responding to the collision of Cretaceous oceanic\n        terrains along the Colombian Pacific margin; and\n    3) as an arc-axial depression or zone of weak extension demarcating the thermal axis of\n        Miocene calc-alkalic magmatism.\nSuch a history contains obvious metallogenetic implications.\n\n                7.1.3 The Central Cordillera\n\nThe Central Cordillera is comprised primarily of amphibolite-grade Proterozoic and greenschist-\ngrade Paleozoic metamorphic rocks (demarcating the western, deformed edge of the Guiana\nShield, and it\u2019s Paleozoic foredeep and marginal sedimentary cover sequence) which have been\nintruded by three Andean-type arcs, of roughly Jurassic, Mid to Late Cretaceous, and Miocene\nto Recent ages. These arcs are all constructed upon continental basement and record the\neastward subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the South American continental block.\nJurassic magmatism is recorded in the Segovia, Sonson, and Ibague Batholiths, all of which are\ngenerally of calc-alkalic, dioritic to quartz dioritic affinity. Associated intermediate volcanic and\npyroclastic strata are preserved in the northern portion of the Cordillera, in the Serran\u00eda de San\nLucas, and in the south in the Department of Huila.\n\nThe Cretaceous Antioquia, Sabanalarga, and Buga Batholiths are also of calc-alkalic affinity,\nhowever are of generally granodioritic to quartz monzonitic character. Finally, reactivated\nmagmatic activity in the Paleogene and again beginning in the Mid- to Late Miocene and\ncontinuing through to the present is recorded in the central through southern portions of the\nCentral Cordillera, and is presently exemplified by the NNE trending chain of Andean calc-alkalic\nstratovolcanic cones stretching from the Department of Caldas, south through to the Colombia-\nEcuador border.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas A.

Because outcrops are scarce, Colombia Crest has not undertaken\nsystematic geologic mapping of the properties and has relied on previous geologic studies,\nwhile principally utilizing stream sediment sampling, rock sampling, soil sampling, and\ngeophysics to define drill programs.\n\nLike other porphyry targets of the region the geology of the Venecia area is dominated by\nTertiary age, andesite to dacite porphyritic rocks and intrusive rocks (diorite and granodiorite).\nThese stocks and smaller apophasis of these rocks intrude and mineralize volcano-sedimentary\nrocks of the Mesozoic age Ca\u00f1as Gordas Group older portions of Combia Formation on the\nproperty.

Known mineralization in\nthe area includes several areas of gold-bearing disseminated mineralization associated with\nandesitic to dacitic porphyry stocks to the north and south of the property.\n\nThe main gold potential is in upper Tertiary volcanic and hypabyssal rocks in the 40 kilometre\nwide zone between the Mistrato and Romeral faults. There is currently major exploration\nactivity at various sites near the Fredonia-Venecia Projects; to the north at Titiribi by Sunward\nResources, and to the south, at La Mina and Quebradona, by Bellhaven and Anglo Ashanti/B2\nGold, respectively.\n\nAlthough located further south the Marmato deposit is considered one of the potential deposit\ntypes for the Fredonia project. At Marmato, epithermal gold mineralization occurs in sheeted\npyrite veins which are hosted by the late Miocene Marmato intermediate porphyry stock\n(radiometric dating gives ages of 6.7 million years for the porphyry intrusion and 5.6 million\nyears for alteration and mineralization). Reported gold resources are 7.5 million ounces\nDr. Thomas A.

Significant alteration and mineralization has already been identified at three\nseparate locations within the Fredonia area and in close proximity to the Quebradona and La\nMina deposits. Several international mining and exploration companies are currently\nconducting grass-roots to advanced exploration along strike from, principally south of, the\nFredonia property package with considerable success (Fig. 2). An aggressive exploration\nprogram has begun on Fredonia's extensive land holdings, emphasizing geologic mapping,\ngeochemical sampling and airborne geophysics identifying drill targets and to develop areas for\nmore detailed follow-up work (See Chapter 10, Exploration).\n\nBecause the phase 1 drilling has been completed at La Arabia, the geologic team now has time\nto evaluate some of the other targets in the 27,700 hectares Fredonia land package, including\nthe Garrucha target and the newly-sampled El Retiro target area. In addition, early stage\nreconnaissance exploration by Grupo de Bullet had identified prospective alteration and\nmineralization in the Vereda La Siberia and El Narciso areas of the Fredonia land package.\n\n        9.1 La Arabia Target\n\nOver the past year, the Company has mainly focused on exploring and drilling the Arabia target,\nstraddling the Colombian Mines/Grupo de Bullet concession boundary (Cover page and Figs. 7,\n8 and 10 below), where geophysics, combined with outcropping gold-mineralized porphyry\nrock, gave the team a starting point on the property. Good potassic alteration is associated\nwith magnetic anomalies within porphyritic diorite.\n\n        9.2 La Garrucha Targets\n\nThe La Garrucha creek target is located within title 7340, to the southeast of Bellhaven's La\nMina project (Fig. 3) and contains both disseminated and fracture fill mineralization within\npropylitically altered volcanic breccias and porphyry intrusive rocks assaying up to 0.36g/t Au\nand 9.29g/t Ag over 1.5m. Cutting across these rocks are a series of generally east-west\ntrending vertical fault zones, up to 3m wide and mineralized with quartz, chlorite, pyrite,\nsphalerite and galena. Assays across these structures returned up to 7.16% Zn and 58g/t Au\nacross 1m.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas A.

Although the samples taken to date did not contain significant\nprecious metals, the geology of the zone merits further work to identify a larger mineralizing\nsystem.\n\n        9.4 El Narciso Target\n\nLocated to the northwest of Bellhaven's La Mina project, mineralization at El Narciso consists of\ndisseminated and fracture filling sulfides (principally pyrite) in altered volcanic rocks and\nintermediate porphyritic rocks. Sulfide content can reach up to 5%, within the argillic and\nchloritic alteration. Only three rock samples were collected from this area of the property.\nWhilst the geochemical results are not economic, the geology identified appears quite\nfavorable and warrants further study.\n\n        9.5 El Retiro Target\n\nIn January of 2013 Colombia Crest announced the discovery of high-grade stream sediment\nsample results collected from the El Retiro target area, in the eastern portion of the Fredonia\nproject, Middle Cauca Belt, Colombia. Grupo Bullet had previously (2010) located artisanal\nminers in that area mining narrow veins. Rock chip channel samples taken in 2010 by Colombia\nCrest Gold geologists returned from a 0.8 meter quartz vein sample returned values up to 8.25\ng/t Au and up to 47.5 g/t Ag. Gold mineralization occurs in quartz veins, hosted in Paleozoic\nmeta-sedimentary rocks of the Cajamarca Complex. Numerous veins in outcrop were also\nidentified for follow-up on future field campaigns. In 2012, a total of 16 samples were collected\nover about 35 square kilometers. The sample results showed from below detection to 839 ppb\ngold (0.84 g/t). The results indicate five distinct drainages with anomalous gold eroding from a\nbedrock lode-gold source \u2013 all targets for follow up sampling. Each basin represents\napproximately two square kilometers in aerial extent.

The project area, shown in Fig.\n21, covers only a portion of the overall property package and is approximately 35 km southwest\nof Medellin, Colombia.\n\nThe MPX crew mobilized to the operations base for the Fredonia Project in La Pintada,\nAntioquia, Colombia on February 20, 2011. The MPX equipment was previously installed into a\nBell Long Ranger L3 Helicopter (Fig. 18) in Medellin, Colombia on November 5, 2010. The first\nflight was completed on February 21, 2011. A total of 5216.3 line-kilometers of data were\nacquired over the single project area which covers a total area of 454 km\u00b2. The survey area was\nflown at a nominal mean terrain clearance of 70 meters along flight lines separated at 100\nmeters, and tie lines at a line separation of 1000 meters.\n\nGeophysical data acquisition involved the use of precision differential GPS positioning, a Pico-\nEnvirotec GRS-10 multi-channel gamma-ray spectrometer system, and a high sensitivity\nmagnetometer installed in a single sensor fixed boom. The Bell Long Ranger helicopter with\nColombian registration HK 4181 was used for this survey.\nDr. Thomas A.

Cutting across these rocks are a series of generally east-west\ntrending vertical fault zones, up to 3m wide and mineralized with quartz, chlorite, pyrite,\nsphalerite and galena. Assays across these structures returned up to 7.16 percent Zn and 58g/t\nAu across 1m. At Garrucha porphyry target, a second pass of stream-sediment sampling\nprogram was completed and results yield anomalous gold up to 98 parts per billion showing a\nclear anomalous area on the north-east part of the concession 7350-B. Multivariate statistics\nhave been applied to data indicating a probable Cu-Mo-Au porphyry mineralization style. These\nare coincident with magnetic anomalies and will lead to additional field work, e.g. soil sampling\nand rock chip sampling, trenching and eventually drilling if warranted. These anomalies are\nlocated less than five kilometers south of the La Mina project, currently being explored by\nBellhaven Copper and Gold (TSX-V: BHV).\n\nIn the eastern sector of the Fredonia project, named El Retiro, rock chip samples taken in 2010\nfrom a 0.8 meter quartz vein channel sample returned values up to 8.25 g/t Au and up to 47.5\ng/t Ag. Gold mineralization occurs in quartz veins, hosted in Paleozoic meta-sedimentary rocks\nof the Cajamarca Complex. The area was first identified by Grupo de Bullet personnel\n(announced August 18, 2010 - Option Agreement) where they had observed small-scale artisan\nmining along several vein-structures in the area. Numerous veins in outcrop were also\nidentified for follow-up on future field campaigns. As a first pass, stream sediment sampling is\nthe most effective tool in this evaluation phase because of its efficiency at evaluating such a\nlarge area fairly quickly. Based on the results above, additional stream sediment sampling will\ncontinue, along with rock chip sampling on new mineralized outcrops that might exist.\n\nThe Vereda La Siberia target is located to the extreme west of the property \u2013 it contains\nchloritic and phyllic alteration of breccias and intermediate volcanic rocks with fine grained\ndisseminated pyrite alteration. Although the samples taken to date did not contain significant\nprecious metals, the geology of the zone merits further work to identify a larger mineralizing\nsystem that may hold economic deposits.\n\nLocated to the northwest of Bellhaven's La Mina project, mineralization at El Narciso consisting\nof disseminated and fracture filling sulfides (principally pyrite) in altered volcanic rocks and\nintermediate porphyritic rocks. Sulfide content can reach up to 5%, within the argillic and\nchloritic alteration. Only three rock samples were collected from this area of the property.\nWhilst the geochemical results are not economic, the geology identified appears quite\nfavorable and warrants further study.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas A.

Ellsworth, 2012) In the\nArabia zone of the Venecia project. All drill hole collars and elevations are to be surveyed by a\nhand held GPS using UTM horizontal WGS84 datum. Precision GPS surveying will follow a\nsuccessful program after Phase I is completed and each collar must be clearly marked and\ncemented with drill hole ID. The author checked the location of the drill holes in the field with\nhis own hand held GPS unit and found that the holes are plotted correctly. Down hole\ndeviation surveying (showing both dip and azimuth) will follow completion of each drill hole\nusing a down hole tool at 30 m depth intervals and digital database backed up immediately to\ngeologists\u2019 hard drive and immediately reviewed by on site geologist for accuracy (request\nsurvey repetition if data appears erroneous). The survey is completed by the driller using the\nrig\u2019s wire line and a E-Z track (Reflex) or equivalent down hole tool provided by the contractor.\nThe tools are sensitive to magnetic minerals so any suspect readings are removed from the\ndatabase where magnetite, pyrrhotite or other magnetic minerals are identified in the core log.\nUnmodified, original down hole survey files are saved.\n\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                               38\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n                12.1.2 Core Handling Procedures at the Drill Site\n\nThe project geologists ensure that the core handling procedures at the drill rigs are of an\nacceptable nature:\n\n    1. The core is removed from the core barrel without any loss on the ground and drill\n       additives are carefully washed from the core.\n    2. The core is properly reassembled and placed in the core box in the correct orientation,\n       and after each drill run the depth of the hole is noted and marked with a wooden block\n       that is inserted into the box at the appropriate location.\n    3. Full core boxes are securely covered and transported once a day (accompanied by a\n       Colombia Crest technical person always) to a secure core logging area at the local camp.\n       The core is never left unattended at the drill site as the project is running two shifts.\n\nThe onsite technician occasionally counts the drill rods down the hole and occasionally\nmeasures the length of a few of the rods, to ensure that the depth shown on the wooden\nblocks corresponds with the actual depth.\n\n        12.2 Geotechnical Logging\nThe objective of the geotechnical logging is to evaluate the characteristics that may affect the\nmining and mineral processing in the plant. Geotechnical characteristics that may affect the\nwork include the fracture frequency, type of fracture, filling of the fractures, voids, and\npartitions throughout the lithological contacts.\n\n    1. The core is rebuilt along the natural breaks and fractures.\n    2. In the areas where the rock quality is low (areas of fault gouge, breccias, earthy core,)\n       the pieces of core are arranged in the \u201cbest way\u201d.\n    3. A trained technical person verifies the position of each meterage blocks in the core\n       boxes and ensures that there is no overlap or excessive distance between them.\n    4. Digital photos are taken before the geological logging and sampling is completed.\n    5. Pre-printed forms are used to fill in with the appropriate data. The drill hole number is\n       written on each page. The geotechnical data is kept separate from the geological data.\n    6. Trained technical assistants are in charge of items 1 to 4, whereas core recovery is\n       measured only by a senior technical assistant. RQD is only carried out by the geologists\n       or a trained technician.\n\n                12.2.1 Core Recovery\n\n    1. Technical assistants repair or join the broken pieces of the core, in order to align the\n       natural fractures and joints, and mechanical breaks, eliminating any kind of artificial\n       space in the core. This procedure makes the measurement operation easier, and also\n       shows where the pieces of the core are mixed. If necessary, the core is rotated in order\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                39\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n       to establish a \u201ccut line\u201d. We take as much time as necessary to complete this step\n       properly.\n    2. The recovery is the actual amount of core (physical) present in each drill run and\n       expressed as a percentage divided by the actual penetration length recorded by the\n       driller. After the core is re joined it is measured along the primary axis running a single\n       line through the center of each piece. The overburden is not considered, just the\n       beginning of the solid rock. When there is a doubt about what is solid rock, the senior\n       technical assistant checks with the geologist.\n\n                12.2.2 RQD Measurement\n\n    1. Rock Quality Designation (RQD). It is a quantitative index of the rock quality based on\n       the recovery procedures. It is defined as the addition of the lengths of core\u2019s pieces >10\n       cm, expressed as a percentage of the total length of the drill run.\n    2. RQD only considers natural breaks that are counted as separate pieces. Breaks\n       produced by the drilling or (mechanical breaks) or breaks at core box ends are not\n       considered.\n    3. Mechanical breaks are identified by clean and fresh breaks:\n            a. Those along the foliation or those with a 90\u00ba angle in reference to the core axis.\n            b. Pieces that can be re-joined and the separation is no more than a hairline\n               fracture.\n    4. Natural breakage characteristics:\n            a. Rounded surfaces, earthy material, weathered\n            b. Has fillings or impregnations\n            c. Are found at any angle in reference to the core axis\n            d. Cannot be totally joined\n    5. If the origin of the breakage is not clear, it is assumed to be a natural break.\n    6. Select all core pieces in a run >10 cm length that represent natural breaks. All those\n       that show evidence of mechanical breakings are considered as a single piece.\n    7. For each run the accumulated measurements are measured with a measuring tape and\n       the data is recorded in the RQD table.\n    8. The length of the largest piece of the core (per run) bound by two natural breakings is\n       measured.\n    9. When a fracture is parallel to the core axis, this is considered as intact rock. We note\n       this occurrence.\n\n        12.3 Geologic Logging\n\nColombia Crest core logging includes detailed descriptions of the lithologies, structures,\nalteration, and mineralization. The logs include the core recoveries documented over regular\nintervals, assay sample intervals and numbers, and density/specific gravity determinations. The\nColombia Crest forms are designed for easy conversion to a digital database and future\nresource estimates.\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                40\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n\n\nA collection (skeleton core) of representative rock mineral and alteration types are collected\nand labeled to facilitate the identification of such features by different geologists and core log\ntraining. Skeleton core ensures consistency over time in lithological, alteration and\nmineralogical descriptions.\n\n        12.4 Sampling and Transportation\n\n                12.4.1 Core Sampling\n\nAll drill core samples were cut and sampled over nominal two-meter intervals at the Company's\non-site field camp, then sent to the ACME Prep Laboratory in Medellin, Colombia. The author\nobserved the core storage facility on La Rio Arabia and observed the proper manner in which\nthe core was stored (Fig. 29).\n\nAll drill core samples were sent to the Acme Labs Prep Laboratory in Medellin, Colombia. The\nchosen preparation method was code R200-250, which consists of crushing the entire sample\nto 80% passing 10 mesh (2 millimetres), split 250 grams and pulverize to 85% passing 200 mesh\n(75 microns). Once prepared, 200 gram pulps were shipped to the AcmeLabs in Vancouver,\nCanada for analysis. Gold was assayed under package G601 which consists of 30 grams fire\nassay and atomic absorption with detection limits from 0.005 to 10 parts per million and with a\ngravimetric finish for over limits. A multi element package (1EX) of 41 elements including silver,\nbase metals and pathfinder elements was also analyzed using ICP mass spectroscopy. The ICP\nmulti-element analysis uses a four-acid total digestion prior to analysis.\n\nOne half of the core is split and sent to the laboratory for preparation prior to assaying. During\nthe geological core logging process, the sample intervals down the hole are marked on both the\ncore and the box. A cutting/splitting line is marked with a grease pen by the geologist to ensure\nthat the core cutter/splitter does not introduce a bias during the splitting process if deemed\nnecessary. Normally Colombia Crest uses a 2 meter sample interval across mineralized core\nwhere disseminated. All core should be cut and sampled unless there is no doubt whatsoever\nthere is mineralization or alteration present. Even whole number meterage depth intervals\nshould be used to simplify the database.\n\nThe project geologists ensure that the core is properly split in half by a trained technician using\na diamond saw, when necessary. One half of the core is returned to the core box, in the same\norientation, while the other half is placed in the pre-numbered (both sides of the bag).\nDisaggregated material is handled carefully to avoid or minimize sampling bias.\n\nOnce the sample is completed, the bag is immediately sealed. The corresponding sample tag is\nincluded in the bag with the sample. Each sample booklet page will have the drill hole ID on the\nfirst page and depth interval marked on each page. Additionally a table showing corresponding\ndrill hole ID, sample depth interval and sample number is tallied. The sample card ticket\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                41\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\nshowing only sample number is inserted into each sample bag and the sample number written\nwith a marker outside each bag. The individual sample tags that are kept by Colombia Crest\nalways reserve pre-assigned sample numbers to account for the insertion of blanks, duplicates\nand standards that will be submitted along with each sample shipment. All samples are then\nentered in an Excel database.\n\nAll coarse rejects and pulps from the core must be retained by the laboratory and returned to\nColombia Crest and warehoused with the core.\n\n\n\n\n                       Fig. 29: Arabia Camp Temporary Core Storage Facility\n\n\n                12.4.2 Sample Shipping and Transportation\n\nTechnical assistants and geologists never leave a partially completed sample unattended. The\ncore and samples are kept in a secure location at the camp and we have 24 hour security at the\ncamp. Samples are shipped on a regular basis, generally by each or partial drill hole, to Acme\nLab shipping point at Medellin where they prepared. The unshipped samples are kept in a\nsecure location. The individual sample bags are placed in strong shipping sacks and the contents\nof each shipping sack are recorded. The Chain of Custody documents accompany the samples\nall the time. Signatures of delivering and receiving persons appear on the Chain of Custody\nforms.\n\nThe primary laboratory, Acme Lab, is advised by E-mail about the pending shipments. The\nlaboratory is never informed about the identity of the control samples.\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                               42\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n\n\n        12.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control\n\nThe Colombia Crest QA/QC program at Venecia can be described as the random insertion of\nvarious control sample types as part of our ongoing core drilling program. Many of these\ncontrol samples are collected and inserted by Colombia Crest personnel at the Venecia camp\nduring the core sampling process. They include:\n\n    1. Core twin samples (\u00bc core samples); these samples are mainly collected to assess the\n       mineralization homogeneity and sampling variance. The original half-core samples are\n       again cut in half, one quarter representing the original sample and the other quarter\n       representing the twin sample (the actual interval value used resource calculations is the\n       average of both determinations). Half the core remains in the box.\n\n    2. Coarse Blanks are coarse samples of barren material; these samples indicate if\n       contamination is produced during preparation. The coarse blanks should be inserted\n       immediately after highly mineralized samples. The blanks can be collected from any\n       barren outcrop composed of fresh granite or limestone free of any sulfides or oxides.\n\n    3. Additionally, previously processed control samples are also inserted by Colombia Crest\n       personnel in the submission batches, respecting the pre-established sample sequence.\n       These samples include:\n\n    4. Standards (or certified reference materials, CRM) are samples with very well established\n       grades, prepared normally under special conditions by certified commercial labs. The\n       standards for Colombia Crest have been prepared by Rock Labs Laboratories (Appendix\n       3) in Aukland, New Zealand. The standards are to estimate the assay accuracy, together\n       with the check samples. Colombia Crest is using three (3) standards:\n                                     Standard      Au ppm\n                                     OxA89         0.0836\n                                     SG56          1.027\n                                     SK62          4.075\n       The standards are alternatively inserted in the batches. The grades of these samples\n       remain \u201cblind\u201d to the analytical laboratory (ies). The primary (Acme Lab) and secondary\n       (ALS Chemex) laboratories are not involved in the preparation of the standards.\n\n    5. Check samples (or external pulp duplicates) are second splits of finally prepared samples\n       routinely analyzed by the primary laboratory and resubmitted to a secondary laboratory\n       (an external certified laboratory) under a different sample number. These samples are\n       used to estimate the assay accuracy, together with the standards.\n\nIn addition to the specified purposes, the control samples are also useful to alert about possible\nmix-ups produced during manipulation. Although the proportion of control samples may be\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                43\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\nadjusted during the drill program at Venecia, depending on the results, control samples now\naccount for more than 25% of the total samples at the start of the program. The proportions of\ncontrol samples currently inserted at Venecia are presented below:\n\n    \uf0b7   Core Twin Samples 1 per 20\n    \uf0b7   Coarse Blanks 1 per 20\n    \uf0b7   Low Grade Standard 1 per 60\n    \uf0b7   Medium Grade Standard 1 per 60\n    \uf0b7   High Grade Standard 1 per 60\n    \uf0b7   Check Assays both pulp and coarse reject 1 per 20\n\nThe inserted control samples in total equal 3 samples per 20 (3 standards and 1 blank)\nequivalent to 15% of the total samples. Follow up check assays are selected by the geologist\nfrom mineralized zones and used as commercial laboratory control.\n\n        12.6 Management and Analysis of Geological and Geotechnical Data\n\n                12.6.1 Management of the Geological Data\n\nTo carry out an effective exploration program, all of the geological and geotechnical data,\n(including relevant historical data) is being compiled and entered into a database program\nincluding up-to-date drill sections and plans. Future drill hole sites, orientation and angles are\nadjusted as the geologic model is refined.\n\nThe ultimate objective is to develop a comprehensive and coherent geological (geometric)\nmodel based on sound and accurate geological information, as the basis for future resource\nestimates.\n\n                12.6.2 Analysis of the QA/QC Assay Data\n\nThe Colombia Crest QA/QC program is generating an abundance of data from the twin samples,\nduplicates, blanks, and standards. This requires a systematic review and assessment. A\ncombination of X-Y scatter plots, precision plots, cumulative frequency plots, control charts,\nThompson-Howarth plots, etc., will be used during the analysis of the QA/QC data. The plots\nwill be prepared and monitored on an on-going basis so that any sample related problems\nencountered are identified at an early stage and can be dealt with in an efficient and prompt\nmanner. Additional data analysis will be done as necessary.\n\nAll drill core samples were sent to the Acme Labs Prep Laboratory in Medellin, Colombia. The\nchosen preparation method was code R200-250, which consists of crushing the entire sample\nto 80% passing 10 mesh (2 millimeters), split 250 grams and pulverize to 85% passing 200 mesh\n(75 microns). Once prepared, 200 gram pulps are shipped to the AcmeLabs in Vancouver,\nCanada for analysis.

Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                 44\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\ngravimetric finish for over limits. A multi element package (1EX) of 41 elements including silver,\nbase metals and pathfinder elements was also analyzed using ICP mass spectroscopy. The ICP\nmulti-element analysis uses a four-acid total digestion prior to analysis.\n\nEach sample batch will be reviewed by Colombia Crest after the laboratory delivers the assay\nresults. Depending on the results of this review, some actions could be necessary, such as assay\nrepetitions, sample re-labeling (in case of mix-ups), etc. Once the batch is considered final, this\nwill be documented in the final database by Colombia Crest. Regular contact between the\npeople monitoring the QA/QC results and the Colombia Crest geologists is crucial during the\nentire sampling and analytical program. It is important to maintain communication with the\nlaboratory and notified of inaccurate results that are manifested in the QC program.\n\nMeticulous documentation of the process is crucial to maintain an accurate database and to\nensure that the audit process can be completed as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\n                12.6.3 Analysis of the Exploration Assay Data, Double Data Entry and Audits\n\nThe assay database will be subjected to basic statistics to determine the characteristics of the\nmineralization, investigate the nature of data populations and outliers, and if possible, identify\nspecific domains of mineralization. This is an on-going process as the project evolves. It is\nrecommended that Colombia Crest initiate a program of double data entry as part of the\nQA&QC program.\n\nData entry by the double key-punch data entry system has proven to be the most effective\nmethod to remove entry errors from databases. This entry system permits the validation, audit,\ncleaning and clarification of a database on a real-time basis with the intent to limit data entry\nerror to less than 0.1%, well within the rate of error acceptable for data used in a resource\nmodel. This system of data entry dedicates two teams of one or more people to enter data that\nwas captured on hard copy forms in their individual databases on separate local computers.\nThe commercial software, acQuire\u00ae, or an equivalent, will be used as the effective program to\nenter the data. Each team will enter the same data to an identical database. The databases are\ncompared. The end product of this process is a validated database immediately prepared for\nuse in a resource model after the last entry of data, without delays for post program validation,\nauditing, cleaning and clarification of data due to entry errors. However the double entry data\nmethod may not be necessary for Venecia\u2019s Phase I program.\n\nA third party audit will be completed on a regular basis during the phase II (2013) drilling\nprogram. This will include several visits to the site during and near the end of the program. The\ndrill sites, the on-site sampling facilities, and primary analytical lab should be visited in order to\nverify that sample handling, preparation and assaying are conducted in accordance with best\npractices and that any required adjustments are made at an early stage to prevent costly re-\nevaluations down the road and allowing the database to be declared \u201cacceptable for resource\nestimation purposes\".\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                  45\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n\n\nThe soil samples were sent to the ACME Prep Laboratory in Colombia who forwarded sample\npulps to the ACME Lab in Vancouver, Canada for analysis. The chosen preparation method was\nPreparation Code SS80 Dry at -60oC, which consists of up to 500 gram sample sieved through 80\nmesh screen so that up to 100 gram sample remains. The 100 gram sample then uses the\nSP100 Preparation; the soils are pulverized to -100 mesh in a mild-steel pulverizer. A multi\nelement package of 41 elements (IF02 Analysis) including silver, base metals and pathfinder\nelements were analyzed using ICP mass spectrometry. The ICP multi-element analysis uses an\naqua regia digestion prior to analysis.\n\n\n\n13.0 DATA VERIFICATION\n\nWith eighteen holes completed to the end of March 2012 by Colombia Crest and extensive\nsurface geochemistry in streams, soils, and bedrock, I conclude that an industry\u2010standard\nprogram of QA\u2010QC appropriate to the early\u2010stage of exploration has been in place for most if\nnot all of this work.\n\nSince taking options on the properties of Grupo Bullet and Colombian Mines, the Colombia\nCrest sampling and assaying programs have been controlled by a systematic application of\ncertified standards and blanks, along with Colombia Crest\u2019s own field duplicate and laboratory\nduplicate checks. The use of an independent international preparation and assay laboratory,\nALS Chemex, adds additional assurance that assay results are representative of the\nmineralization encountered on the property.\n\n        13.1 Assay Certificate and Drill Hole Database Validation\n\nThe author selected three random sample intervals from the core from DDH 12 AR-04 in the\nColombia Crest core shed for the purpose of checking drill hole database for validation. The\nhalf-core check samples for quartering by saw cutter were collected personally by the author\n(Table 6). The author then compared the assay lab certificates from ALS Minerals (formally ALS\nChemex) to the values that were in the database. This verification sampling was intended only\nas a check of the general level of copper\u2010gold mineralization found on the Arabia zone, but is\nnot intended as a comprehensive QA\u2010QC assessment for the purposes of resource estimation.\n\nThe results of the check assays compared to the Colombia Crest originals are within acceptable\nprecision. Colombia Crest put no limitations on the author\u2019s review of the exploration site.\nDuring the authors\u2019 site visit, logging procedures, sample collection and preparation procedures\nwere reviewed. It was noticed that when the assay reported on the certificated were at the\nlower detection limit (LDL), and recorded as such, that Colombia Crest recorded the LDL value\nin the database. The author recommends that Colombia Crest record half the value of the LDL\nin the database when further test results are not available.\n\nDr. Thomas A.

The Cerro Vetas deposit is the most understood\nbecause the majority of drilling has been conducted there.

The Cerro Vetas porphyry\nhosts typical porphyry copper alteration with a barren to weakly mineralized prograde potassic\ncore, surrounded by a mineralized but poorly developed phyllic zone and a well-developed and\nmineralized retrograde argillic zone. The outermost propylitic alteration is widespread.\n\nIt is Sunward\u2019s belief that significant potential exists within the Project to grow resources\nsignificantly by further drilling at Cerro Vetas and drill testing other priority geochemical-\ngeophysical anomalies. The upgrading of the resource at Cerro Vetas will permit economic\nmodelling and further input into the technical understanding of the area. Coincident\ngeophysical and hyperspectral anomalies represent priority targets that warrant follow up\nwork. Beyond porphyritic style mineralization there may be an opportunity associated with coal\nseams of the Amaga Formation exposed within the lease confines.\n\nOn March 1, 2013 Sunward Resources announced that initial metallurgical test work, including\nLock Cycle flotation tests, conducted on material sourced from the Cerro Vetas Zone (\"Cerro\nVetas\") of the 100%-owned Titiribi project, demonstrated that a conventional flotation process\ncan recover approximately 86% and 75% of contained copper and gold, respectively to a\nsaleable copper flotation concentrate. Furthermore, additional testing showed that 85% of gold\ncontained in the Northwest Breccia Zone (\"Northwest Breccia\") can be recovered by producing\nlimited amounts of a pyrite flotation concentrate which could in turn be sold or treated in a\nsmall gold recovery circuit.\n\n        14.2 La Mina Project, Bellhaven Copper and Gold\n\nA Technical Report on the La Mina property, held by Bellhaven Copper & Gold Inc. was written\nby Scott E.

The\nproject consists of a 6 x 4 km wide zone containing five gold-bearing porphyry-style systems.\nGeologically the deposits appear to be related to a complex series of variable porphyritic, calc-\nalkaline, acid-intermediate rocks which have intruded a sequence of more basic volcaniclastics.\n\nDrilling commenced in early 2008, when B2Gold was operator; they completed an initial\n5,300m drill program to test two of the five zones, including the La Aurora zone where trench\nsampling has returned up to 41.5 m at 2.1 g/t Au, as well as the La Sola zone where surface rock\nchip samples have consistently returned greater than 1.5 g/t Au.\n\nIn June 2008, B2Gold announced results from the first six drill holes, all drilled on the La Aurora\ntarget, which included 86.3m at 2.08 g/t Au, 2.6 g/t Ag and 0.166% Cu as well as longer\nintercepts such as 228.9m at 0.8 g/t Au, 2.0 g/t Ag and 0.154% Cu. In August 2008, B2Gold\nreleased further results from the La Aurora zone, including 182.4m at 1.07 g/t Au, 1.2g/t Ag and\n0.189% Cu and 85m at 1.2g/t Au, 2.8g/t Ag and 0.247% Cu.

Many Andean and Caribbean cultures inhabited the region before the arrival of\nthe Spanish in the 1500s. The Spanish arrived along the coastal areas of Colombia and the\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                49\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\ncountry became Spain's main source of gold. Cartagena and Bogota were founded by mid-\ncentury.\n\nSpain increased taxation on the colonists to fund their home-front war expenses, which led to a\nrevolution in 1819, seeing the defeat of the Spanish. The independent Republic of Gran was\nformed, including Colombia, Ecuador, Panam\u00e1 and Venezuela. By the early 20th century, all of\nthe original partners had withdrawn from the association, and in 1905, Colombia became a\nsovereign state. In recent history the country has experienced unrest in the form of political\nassassinations, internal governmental conflicts, guerrilla activities and drug wars.\n\nColombia has a total area of approximately 1,138,910 square kilometers with an estimated\npopulation of around 43 million (2005 Census - World Atlas, 2008). The nation is located at the\nnorthwestern corner of South America, and bordered by Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and\nPanama, with coastline along both the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean (Fig. 30).\n\nThe geography of Colombia consists of the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands, the eastern Amazon\nlowlands that extend to its borders with Brazil and Venezuela, and the western third of\nColombia which is crossed by three rugged and rocky parallel ranges of the Andes Mountains,\nnamely the Eastern, Central, and Western Cordilleras, with the highest point some 5,775m\nabove sea level. These elevations are the source of the most significant rivers in Colombia\nincluding the Cauca, Magdalena and Putumayo. The Cauca and Magdalena (which flow\nnorthward) separate the three principal Andean mountain ranges, draining into the Caribbean\nSea.\n\n                15.1.2 Colombian Physiography\n\nColombia can be divided into four geographic regions: the Andean highlands, consisting of the\nthree Andean ranges and intervening valley lowlands; the Caribbean coastal lowlands; the\nPacific coastal lowlands (separated from the Caribbean lowlands by swamps at the base of the\nIsthmus of Panama) and Eastern Colombia, a great plain that lies to the east of the Andes\nincluding the Amazon portion of the country. The majority of the population is concentrated in\nthe Andean highlands and valleys. The Andean region is the centre of national political and\neconomic power, with most of the country's population in large cities, including Bogota,\nMedellin, and Cali, the three most populous. The Cauca Valley and the Antioquia highlands are\nperhaps the most dynamic centers of economic activity and growth.\n\nColombia\u2019s climate is tropical but annual precipitation is variable. Climatic differences are\nrelated to altitude and the displacement of the inter-tropical convergence zone between the\ntwo major air masses from which the northeast and southeast trade winds originate. The\nclimate of the tropical rainforest in the Amazon region, the northern Pacific coast, and the\ncentral Magdalena valley is marked by an annual rainfall of over 2,500 mm and annual average\ntemperatures above 23\u00baC. Temperature is directly related to elevation and average\ntemperature decreases uniformly by about 0.6\u00ba C per hundred meters of ascent. Popular\n\nDr. Thomas A.

In the\nhighlands the capital, Bogota, at 2,640 m has an average of 223 days of precipitation, an\naverage rainfall of 1,000 mm and mean temperature of 14\u00ba C. The climate of the high mountain\nregions or p\u00e1ramos that range between 3000 and 4600 m, is characterized by average\ntemperatures below 10\u00ba C (Suttie et al., 2001).\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                 51\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n                15.1.3 Politics and Financial Status\n\nPolitical and internal unrest has limited the economic and social development of Colombia. It\nhas recently been recovering and is now the fourth-largest economy in South America.\n\nIn recent years, Colombia has managed to sustain economic growth and during 2007 the\nColombian economy grew over 7%. According to the National Planning Department, poverty\nhas reduced from 56% in 2002 to 45% in 2006 and extreme poverty went down from 22% to\n12% during the same period.\n\nThe Government of Colombia takes place in a framework of a democratic republic as\nestablished in the Colombian Constitution of 1991 with countrywide elections every four years.\nThe Colombian government is divided into three branches of power; the executive, legislative\nand judicial with special control institutions and electoral institutions. The President of\nColombia is the highest representative of the executive branch of government and is also the\nhead of state with supreme administrative authority. At a provincial level the executive is\nmanaged by department governors. At the municipal level the executive is managed by mayors.\n\nThe legislative branch of government in Colombia is represented by the National Congress of\nColombia which is formed by an Upper House, the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives.\nAt a provincial level the legislative branch is represented by department assemblies and at the\nmunicipal level with municipal councils. Both the legislative and executive branches share most\nof the government power while the judicial branch of Colombia functions as an independent\nbody from the other two branches which are vested with a shared power.\n\n        15.2 Mining Laws of Colombia\n\nThere are 362 articles that govern mining in Colombia and these laws were established in 2001.\nMining legislation is administered by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The right to explore or\nexploit an area is given by the application and granting of a concession. Once a concession is\ngranted it is kept by the concessionaire for as long as it is wanted providing work is being\ncarried out and the concession is kept in good standing, as stipulated by Chapter XII of the\nmining laws. The concession is free to be sold on to other parties providing they follow the laws\nof mining.\n\n        15.3 Mining and Exploration Industry\n\nMining in Colombia began in the 1500s. Although significant in the colonial economy, it has\nnever commanded a large portion of Colombia's GDP in modern times. With the discovery and\nexploitation of coal reserves, the role of mining has expanded from the late 1980s. It has grown\nin importance to the national economy along with a growth in the scale of mining operations\ninvolving precious metals and quarrying. Gold is the most important metal in terms of gross\nrevenues. Other metals exploited include platinum and silver, which are extracted in much\nsmaller quantities.\nDr. Thomas A. Henricksen\nMarch 30, 2013\n                                                52\n\f", "Fredonia-Venecia Technical Report\n\n\n\n\nColombia also produces over 90 percent of the world's emeralds. Other metals common to\nColombia include nickel, small amounts of iron ore, copper and bauxite with non-metallic\nmining for commodities such as salt, limestone, sulfur, gypsum, dolomite, barite, feldspar, clay,\nmagnetite, mica, talcum, and marble carried out on a small scale. Colombia still imports\nsubstances such as iron, copper, and aluminum to meet its industrial needs (Federal Research\nDivision, 2009).\n\nGovernment efforts to expand mining in Colombia were needed to encourage private and\nforeign investment and in the late 1980s much of Colombia remained inadequately explored\nwith reserve estimates considered only marginally reliable. The government set a policy of\ndeveloping infrastructure (roads, electricity, and communications), providing technical\nassistance and encouraging sound credit and legal policies to minimize problems with land\ntitling. Through joint ventures and the promotion of small mining companies, government\nofficials are encouraging the mining industry.\n\n\n\n16.0 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nPhase 1 drill holes were widely spaced (100 \u2013 400 meters apart), testing a series of geophysical\nor geochemical anomalies across the Arabia porphyry complex, with the goal of identifying the\nbest potential areas for further exploration. The Arabia porphyry complex is situated partially\non the Venecia concession (IH6-10331) under option from Colombian Mines Corp., and partially\non the Fredonia concession (7350) under option from Grupo de Bullet SA.\n\nThe best gold mineralization in the Arabia zone is located on coincident rock sampling, soil\nsampling, and aeromagnetic anomalies which have been tested near surface. A potassically\naltered porphyritic diorite, locally diorite porphyry, is the host rock for the best porphyry-style\nmineralization which drilling has shown as much as 182 m of 0.38 g/t Au.\n\nEl Retiro area exhibits five distinct drainages have anomalous gold in stream sediments, up to\n0.84 g/t. Gold mineralization occurs in quartz veins, hosted in Paleozoic meta-sedimentary\nrocks of the Cajamarca Complex. The area was first identified by Grupo de Bullet personnel\n(announced August 18, 2010 - Option Agreement) where they had observed small-scale artisan\nmining along several vein-structures in the area. Numerous veins in outcrop were also\nidentified for follow-up on future field campaigns. As a first pass, stream sediment sampling is\nthe most effective tool in this evaluation phase because of its efficiency at evaluating such a\nlarge area fairly quickly. Based on the results above, additional stream sediment sampling will\ncontinue, along with rock chip sampling on new mineralized outcrops that might exist.\n\nGrass roots exploration has just begun on the Garrucha targets beginning with the current\nstream sediment sampling, and will be followed by soil sampling, rock chip sampling and\neventual drilling in 2013. Results of the stream sediment sampling indicates two consecutive\nDr. Thomas A.

The Garrucha target area is located just 5 kilometers south of Bellhaven Copper and\nGold\u2019s (TSX-V: BHV) La Mina project and 25 kilometres north of AngloGold\u2019s Quebradona\nProject. The two Garrucha Porphyry targets lie entirely on two of the 16 concessions held\nunder the Fredonia Agreement with Grupo de Bullet\n\nAt Garrucha porphyry target, a second pass of stream-sediment sampling program was\ncompleted and results yield anomalous gold up to 98 parts per billion showing a clear\nanomalous area on the north-east part of the concession 7350-B. Multivariate statistics have\nbeen applied to data indicating a probable Cu-Mo-Au porphyry mineralization style (Jan. 14,\n2013, Gold Crest news release).\n\n\n17.0 RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the drilling results from Phase 1 at the Arabia zone, the Phase 2 drill program in 2013\nat Arabia should be limited to drilling from near the bottom of Arabia Creek within the\nmineralized porphyritic diorite \u201cdiscovered\u201d in the 2012 drilling (Figs. 31, 32, and 33). These\nthree figures show that the mineralization in the porphyritic diorite is increasing to the\nsoutheast and possibly to the east where no drilling has been initiated. A southeast-directed\nhole, from the same platform as hole AR12-4, at an angle of -45 degrees should determine if\nthe potassically altered porphyritic diorite continues to be mineralized in that direction. Even\nthough drill hole AR12-4, the best mineralized hole of the program, has been mostly logged as\npropylitic alteration, it is possible that this alteration type has retrograded after potassic\nalteration, particularly with all the magnetite I observed in the core from this hole.\n\nMy observations in the field, combined with the drilling results, suggest that only part of the\ntop of the porphyritic diorite stock has been tested and that the system becomes more\nmineralized to the southeast, as shown in Fig. 9. However, for the most part the porphyritic\ndiorite contains low grade gold (< less than 0.5 g/t Au) in the area drilled. The drilling in 2013\nshould target expansion of zones with the highest grade gold intercepts (holes 4, 8 and possibly\nwest of hole 15) associated with the porphyritic diorite with the attempt to vector the assays\nwith sections and plan views to see if and where the grade is increasing.\n\nApproximately 2000 meters of drilling in four-five holes should be carried out to test the deeper\npotential of the porphyritic diorite at the Arabia Zone in Arabia creek.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Thomas A.
