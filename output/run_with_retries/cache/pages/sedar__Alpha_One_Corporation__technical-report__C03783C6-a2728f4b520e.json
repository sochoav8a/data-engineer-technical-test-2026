(Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by Donald\nChristie, director of Solvista Gold Corporation (Solvista Gold), to prepare an independent\nTechnical Report on the Guadalupe Project, Department of Antioquia, Republic of\nColombia. The purpose of this report is to document the technical information available\non this project. This report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral\nProjects. Scott Wilson RPA visited the property on February 16 to 17, 2010.\n\n\nThe Guadalupe Project consists of 24 mining titles, including 11 applications, totalling\napproximately 61,981.4 ha located within the municipalities of Guadalupe, Gomez Plata,\nAmalfi, Carolina del Principe, Anori, Angostura, and Campamento in the Department of\nAntioquia, Colombia.\n\n\nSolvista Gold is the owner of a 100% indirect interest in the mining titles comprising the\nGuadalupe Project as well as the separate Caramanta Project (which is the subject of a\nseparate technical report). Solvista Gold\u2019s wholly-owned Colombian subsidiary,\nSociedad Minera Solvista Colombia S.A.S. (Solvista Colombia), is in the process of\nbecoming the registered owner of all of the mining titles forming the Guadalupe Project.\nThe process of transferring the mining titles to Solvista Colombia is on-going. Scott\nWilson RPA understands that as of the date of this report, all of the mining titles\navailable for transfer have been transferred to Solvista Colombia and such transfer is in\nthe process of being registered at the National Mining Registry.\n\n\nThe mining titles comprising the Guadalupe Project have been acquired by Solvista\nGold\u2019s parent company, Norvista Resources Corporation (Norvista), from Bullet Holding\nCorporation (Bullet) and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Grupo de Bullet S.A.\nNorvista has made payments to Bullet in the amount of US$1,000,000 and into Solvista\nGold in the amount of US$1,000,000 for working capital and operating expenses on the\nGuadalupe and Caramanta projects. No further payments are required.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                 Page 1-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\nCurrently, the major asset associated with the Guadalupe Project is a large land position\nstrategically located within a known metallogenic belt and thought to be underlain by\nprospective lithologies.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSolvista Gold has acquired a 100% indirect interest in a large land package in the\nDepartment of Antioquia located along the contact between the Cretaceous-aged, sub-\nalkalic Antioquia Batholith to the south and San Pablo Formation, a mixed series of\nmetamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic rocks ranging from Paleozoic through to\nCretaceous age, in the north. The Guadalupe Project is thought to be prospective for\nboth intrusion related gold deposits and mesothermal vein-style deposits. This area has\nnot had the benefit of a systematic exploration program using modern techniques.\n\n\nA property wide prospecting program designed to rapidly identify target areas with the\npotential for near surface gold and/or copper deposits was undertaken by a subsidiary of\nSolvista Gold\u2019s joint venture partner Bullet, Grupo de Bullet S.A., in 2009. Based on the\nresults of rock and float samples, Bullet identified three principal targets areas for follow-\nup work.\n\n\nTo date, mineralization on the Guadalupe Project has been restricted to local small-\nscale, hand mining of narrow veins and shears, mainly for gold. Production figures from\nthese efforts are not available.\n\n\nScott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Solvista Gold\u2019s Guadalupe Project is an early\nstage exploration property with good potential to host significant mineralization and\nwarrants a systematic exploration effort.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nScott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Solvista Gold\u2019s Guadalupe Project is an attractive\nearly stage exploration property and merits a significant exploration program.\nRecommended Phase I work, beginning as soon as operationally practical, includes:\n\n\n   \u2022   the acquisition of satellite imagery and a digital elevation model,\n   \u2022   a property wide geological mapping and sampling program, and\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                     Page 1-2\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                  www.scottwilson.com\n\n   \u2022   the interpretation of the combined airborne magnetic, electromagnetic, and\n       radiometric survey..\n\n\nThe proposed Phase I work should not require environmental permitting. All proposed\nPhase I field work should be able to be completed using hand-held GPS instruments and\nshould not require cutting a grid.\n\n\nContingent upon the Phase I program results, a recommended Phase II program,\nenvisioned to begin in early 2011, consists of:\n\n\n   \u2022   establishing cut grids over airborne geophysical or geological targets,\n   \u2022   soil sampling and detailed geological mapping and sampling over the grids, and\n   \u2022   detailed Induced Polarization (IP)/resistivity surveying over anomalous areas.\n\n\nGrids should be established with 100 m spaced lines. First pass soil sampling can be\ncompleted on a 100 m X 100 m grid with in-fill sampling on a 50 m X 50 m grid if\nrequired.\n\n\nCompletion of the proposed programs should identify targets for prioritizing and\nsubsequent drill testing.\n\n\nDetails of the recommended exploration programs can be found in Table 1-1.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                   Page 1-3\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                            www.scottwilson.com\n\n                       TABLE 1-1 PROPOSED BUDGETS\n                   Solvista Gold Corporation - Guadalupe Project\n\n                                    Item                            US$\n   Phase I\n   Head Office Services                                              25,000\n   Project Management/Staff Cost                                     50,000\n   Expense Account/Travel Costs                                      25,000\n   Holding & Option Costs                                           175,000\n   Satellite Imagery & Digital Elevation Model                       40,000\n   Geology - Mapping & Sampling                                      40,000\n   Geophysical Consulting - Interpretation                           25,000\n   Field Labour                                                      25,000\n   Analyses (including shipping)                                     25,000\n   Accommodations/Camp Costs                                         25,000\n   Security & Social                                                 25,000\n   Transportation & Communications                                   25,000\n   Subtotal                                                         505,000\n   Contingency                                                       50,000\n   TOTAL                                                            555,000\n\n\n   Phase II\n   Head Office Services                                              25,000\n   Project Management/Staff Cost                                     50,000\n   Expense Account/Travel Costs                                      25,000\n   Holding & Option Costs                                           175,000\n   Gridding                                                          50,000\n   Geology                                                           50,000\n   Soil Sampling                                                     25,000\n   IP Survey                                                        150,000\n   Geophysical Consultant                                            25,000\n   Field Labour                                                      50,000\n   Analyses (including shipping)                                     25,000\n   Accommodation/Camp Costs                                          50,000\n   Transportation/Communications/Shipping                            25,000\n   Security & Social                                                 50,000\n   Environmental Studies                                             25,000\n   Subtotal                                                         800,000\n   Contingency                                                       80,000\n   TOTAL                                                            880,000\n\n\n\n\nSolvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                         Page 1-4\nTechnical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                  www.scottwilson.com\n\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\nPROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION\nThe Guadalupe Project comprises one contiguous block with an area of approximately\n61,981.4 ha, comprised of 24 mining titles consisting of (i) 11 concession agreements, of\nwhich 6 concession agreements covering an aggregate of 5,954.98 ha are in full force\nand effect and 5 concession agreements covering 1,977.6871 ha have been granted\nand are in the process of being registered at the National Mining Registry; (ii) 2\nexploration licences totalling 701.00 ha, which have been granted and are in the process\nof being registered at the National Mining Registry, and (iii) 11 applications for\nconcession agreements and exploration licences, of which 4 applications totalling\n6,960.3353 ha have completed technical studies and are in the process of being\ngranted.

An abandoned railway line occurs about 10\nkm south of the property.\n\n\nHISTORY\nColombia was once the largest gold producer in the Spanish Empire. Gold production\nfrom Colombia for the period of 1514 to 1934 is estimated at 49 million ounces. Two-\nthirds of this production was from placer deposits. Subsequent production is estimated at\n30 million ounces. Three-quarters of this production is reported to have come from the\ndepartments of Antioquia and Caldas.\n\n\nAlthough small scale operations have taken place over the years on various licences\ncomprising the Guadalupe Project, record of this production is poorly documented.\n\n\nScott Wilson RPA is not aware of any documentation related to exploration activities,\nincluding diamond drilling, available for any of the subject licences prior to 2008.\n\n\nIn 2009, Grupo de Bullet S.A. undertook a property wide prospecting program designed\nto rapidly identify target areas with potential for near surface gold and/or copper\ndeposits. The program consisted of rock and float sampling at locations considered to be\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                    Page 1-6\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\nof interest. A total of 60 sites were sampled. In addition, 107 pan concentrates were\ncollected with the aim of rapidly recognizing areas with higher potential for gold\nmineralization. Of these, 42 gave positive results. Based on the results of Grupo de\nBullet S.A.\u2019s 2009 work, three principal target areas were identified for follow-up.\n\n\nGEOLOGY\nThe Colombian Cordillera comprises three separate mountain ranges underlain by a\nseries of magmatic arcs that were emplaced along the western margin of South America\nfrom Jurassic through Miocene time. Subduction along an Andean-type continental\nmargin during the Jurassic gave way to accretion of allochthonous island-arc terranes in\nthe Cretaceous and Tertiary. The predominantly calc-alkaline affinity of the subduction-\nrelated magmatism throughout this period coupled with the complex poly-phase\ncompressional structural regime created a favourable metallogenic setting for economic\ngold and copper deposits. The project is located at the northernmost end of the Central\nCordillera.\n\n\nThe geology of the Guadalupe region is dominated by the regional contact between the\nMiddle to Upper Cretaceous-aged Antioquia Batholith to the south, and a mixed series of\nmetamorphic, sedimentary, and volcanic rocks ranging from Paleozoic through\nCretaceous age to the north. The intercalated metamorphic and volcano-sedimentary\n(San Pablo Formation) sequences are arranged in broadly north-south striking belts,\nextending northwards from this roughly east-west striking contact. Contacts within the\nCretaceous-aged volcano-sedimentary sequence are considered conformable, whilst\nthose separating Cretaceous strata from the Paleozoic amphibolite grade metamorphic\nrocks are fault interpreted. Sill-like gabbro through peridotite bodies within the mafic\nportions of the volcano-sedimentary San Pablo Formation suggest ophiolite affinities.\nAdditional late granitoid \u201ccataclastic\u201d dikes within the volcano-sedimentary sequence are\nlikely related to the emplacement of the Antioquia Batholith.\n\n\nThe San Pablo Formation has been divided into two units. The volcanic dominated\n\u201cMetabasalt\u201d unit is considered slightly older and is composed mostly of massive flows\nand submarine basalts with lesser amounts of flow breccias and tuffs. All have suffered\ngreat tectonism, which in part masks regional metamorphic effects. The upper part of\nthe unit is interbedded with a clastic sedimentary sequence dominated by a fine to\nmedium grained quartz arenite facies and a less important conglomerate facies,\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                    Page 1-7\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                   www.scottwilson.com\n\ninterbedded with quartz arenites. Contact metamorphism as a result of the intrusion of\nthe Antioquia Batholith has produced a hornfelsing of the arenitic facies. In summary, the\nSan Pablo Formation is considered to represent \u201cflysch\u201d deposits in geosynclines in\ncoastal basins.\n\n\nThe Antioquia Batholith is a large typically acid to intermediate intrusive body that\ndominates the Central Cordillera of Antioquia. Typically granodioritic in composition, it\nincludes a number of more local variants and its overall genesis is still poorly\nunderstood, as is its role in the formation of gold mineralizing systems.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                 Page 1-8\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                   www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n\n\n2 INTRODUCTION\nScott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc.

The\nproperty consists of an irregularly shaped block extending for approximately 34 km in a\nnorth-south direction by approximately 32 km in an east-west direction. It is centred\napproximately at Latitude 6\u00b050\u2019 N and Longitude 75\u00b015\u2019 W.\n\n\n\nLAND TENURE\nSolvista Gold is the owner of a 100% indirect interest in the mining titles comprising the\nGuadalupe Project as well as the separate Caramanta Project (which is the subject of a\nseparate technical report). Solvista Gold\u2019s wholly-owned Colombian subsidiary,\nSociedad Minera Solvista Colombia S.A.S. (Solvista Colombia), is in the process of\nbecoming the registered owner of all of the mining titles forming the Guadalupe Project.\nThe process of transferring the mining titles to Solvista Colombia is on-going. Scott\nWilson RPA understands that as of the date of this report, all of the mining titles\navailable for transfer have been transferred to Solvista Colombia and such transfer is in\nthe process of being registered at the National Mining Registry.\n\n\nThe Guadalupe Project consists of 24 mining titles consisting of (i) 11 concession\nagreements, of which 6 concession agreements covering an aggregate of 5,954.9838 ha\nare in full force and effect and 5 concession agreements covering 1,977.6871 ha which\nhave been granted and are in the process of being registered at the National Mining\nRegistry; (ii) 2 exploration licences totalling 701.00 ha which have been granted and are\nin the process of being registered at the National Mining Registry, and (iii) 11\napplications for concession agreements and exploration licences, of which 4 applications\ntotalling 6,960.3353 ha have completed technical studies and are in the process of being\ngranted (Figure 4-2). These parcels constitute one large contiguous block and one\nsmaller, separate but adjacent block. Table 4-1 lists the subject lands along with their\nrelevant tenure information. The subject concessions were map-staked and therefore no\nboundary markers exist. As of the effective date of this report, none of the concessions\ncomprising the Guadalupe Project have been surveyed.\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                 Page 4-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\nAll of the subject mining licences are currently in good standing (Valdiri, 2010).\n\n\nThe mining titles comprising the Guadalupe Project were acquired from Bullet Holding\nCorporation (Bullet) and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including Grupo de Bullet S.A.\npursuant to an Association Agreement (the Association Agreement) entered into by\nNorvista Resources Corporation (Norvista) and Bullet dated June 9, 2010. In accordance\nwith the Association Agreement, Solvista Gold was incorporated under the laws of the\nProvince of Ontario and Solvista Gold incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary under the\nlaws of Colombia, Solvista Colombia. Pursuant to the terms of the Association\nAgreement, legal title to all of the mining titles comprising the Guadalupe and Caramanta\nprojects is being, and will be, transferred by Bullet and/or its subsidiaries, as applicable,\nto Solvista Colombia.\n\n\nNorvista has made payments to Bullet in the amount of US$1,000,000 and into Solvista\nGold in the amount of US$1,000,000 for working capital and operating expenses on the\nGuadalupe and Caramanta projects.

The Colombian Mining Code has been changed and amended\non several occasions. The oldest version relevant to the Guadalupe Project is Decree\n2685 of 1988 (the Previous Mining Code), which has been replaced and superseded in\nits entirety by Law 685 of 2001, as amended by Law 1382 of 2010. However, exploration\nlicences that comprise the Guadalupe Project are still governed by the Previous Mining\nCode.\n\n\nMining public policy and the administration of the mining law resides with the Ministry of\nMines and Energy which has delegated the administrative duties to the Regional\nGovernment of the Department of Antioquia and to INGEOMINAS (the Colombian\nGeological Survey). The Secretary of Mines of the Regional Government of Antioquia\nand the Medellin branch of INGEOMINAS are the mining authorities that have\njurisdiction over the Guadalupe Project.\n\n\nUnder Colombian mining law, mineral concessions are map staked and hence do not\nhave physical boundaries. All mineral concessions are drawn using the local Colombian\ncoordinate system.\n\n\nIn Colombia, mining concession agreements consist of three phases, namely, the\nexploration, construction and exploitation phases, and are governed by Law 685 of 2001\nas modified by Law 1382 of 2010. Under the Modified Mining Code, the exploration\nphase is for a three-year period, which can be extended for up to four additional two-\nyear periods for a maximum of eleven years. During the exploration phase, annual\nsurface payments (C\u00e1non Superficiario) are payable to the Colombian government on\nthe basis of one minimum daily salary per hectare. The current c\u00e1non rate is COP\n17,166 per hectare (approximately US$9.01/ha). The surface payment is calculated as\none minimum daily wage per contracted hectare per year for the first five years of the\nexploration phase. During years six and seven of the exploration phase, the payment\nincreases to 1.25 minimum daily wages per contracted hectare per year, and in years\neight to eleven it increases to 1.5 minimum daily wages per contracted hectare per year.\nUpon completion of the exploration phase of a concession, the construction phase is for\na period of three years, and may be extended for a period of one year, after which it\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                 Page 4-4\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\nenters its exploitation phase, in which c\u00e1non fees are no longer payable but are replaced\nby a production royalty payable to the Colombian government. The mining concession\nagreement is granted for an initial term of 30 years. The term may be extended by\nmeans of an agreement negotiation procedure (said renegotiation is not required for\nagreements that predate Law 1382 of 2010).\n\n\nThe main obligations undertaken in the agreement are: (i) the payment of the surface tax\n(c\u00e1non fees) during the exploration, construction and installation phases, (ii) the\nimplementation of a mining-environmental insurance policy (private insurance) covering\nenvironmental risks, and (iii) the payment of royalties to the State during the operation\nstage (replacing the c\u00e1non fees).\n\n\nRegulation of Exploitation Licences, on the contrary, is not divided into three phases but\nconsists of an initial ten-year period, that can be extended for a single equivalent or\nconverted into concession agreements before their expiration, in which exploitation can\ntake place, and in which production royalties are payable to the Colombian government\non the basis of grams extracted.        Exploitation Licences are always preceded by\nExploration Licences. Under these, the title holder was entitled to explore the area for\nthe purpose of determining the existence of mineral reserves, for a term of one to five\nyears, depending on the area to be explored. Upon expiry of the Exploration Licence, the\ntitle holder has a right to an Exploitation Licence. Exploitation Licences were granted for\nsmall-scale mining not exceeding 250,000 m3 of extraction per year per licence.\n\n\nThe application process for concessions and their granting and registration into the\nNational Mining Registry is a lengthy process. Once an application is submitted to the\napplicable mining authority, the mining authority will undertake a technical study to\ndetermine the amount of free ground that is actually available within the area requested\nin the application. Once the technical study is completed, the mining authority may\ndecrease or amend the area to be granted within the application. This determination and\nreport is provided to the applicant and the applicant may either accept or reject such\ndetermination. If the applicant is willing to proceed, the mining authority will proceed with\ndrafting the concession agreement which will be signed by the parties upon completion.\nUpon execution of the concession agreement, the concession agreement must then be\nregistered at the National Mining Registry. Once an applicant has agreed to proceed\nwith the area provided in the technical study, the applicant has an exclusive right to the\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                    Page 4-5\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                 www.scottwilson.com\n\nconcession, as long as the concession agreement is duly signed and concession fees\nare paid in a timely manner.\n\n\n\nHOLDING COSTS\nThe annual cost to maintain the entire property in good standing, including the C\u00e1non\nSuperficiario, annual licence fees and insurance payments would total approximately\nUS$600,000, although approximately US$435,000 of this cost is attributable to\noutstanding applications. Scott Wilson RPA understands that the company intends to\nreduce its land holdings to the core areas of interest in advance of having to make this\npayment.\n\n\n\nROYALTIES AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES\nIn accordance with the terms of the Association Agreement, the Guadalupe Project was\nsubject to a 3% NSR royalty (the Royalty) payable in favour of a corporation\nincorporated by Norvista and Bullet, in exchange for promotional, marketing and other\nservices. Pursuant to an amendment to the Association Agreement dated December 13,\n2010, the Guadalupe Project is no longer subject to the Royalty. Scott Wilson RPA is not\naware of any royalties, back-in rights, or other obligations related to the Association\nAgreement or any other agreements.\n\n\nUpon production, however, the government of Colombia requires the payment of a 4%\ngross royalty, based on 80% of the closing price of the London Bullion Market for an\neffective rate of 3.2%.\n\n\n\nSURFACE RIGHTS\nThe surface rights are held by various third party landowners and communities.\nExploration access easements will have to be negotiated and agreed upon with the\nsurface rights holders.\n\n\nAll exploration recommended in the Phase I and II programs can proceed without the\nneed for a formal land use agreement to be signed with the surface rights holders.\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                Page 4-6\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                  www.scottwilson.com\n\nPERMITTING\nEarly stages of exploration including geological mapping and stream or soil\ngeochemistry do not require permitting. However, exploration activity involving soil\ndisturbance including trenching and road and drill pad construction requires an\nenvironmental management plan or an environmental licence approved by the regional\nenvironmental authority, CORANTIOQUIA. Drilling will require a water use and return\npermit, which may be included in the environmental licence granted for the project.\n\n\nAll exploration projects require environmental insurance which must be purchased on an\nannual basis during the entire life of the Concession Contract.\n\n\nTo the best of Scott Wilson RPA\u2019s knowledge, there are no environmental liabilities\nassociated with the property.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                 Page 4-7\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA

INFRASTRUCTURE AND\nPHYSIOGRAPHY\nACCESSIBILITY\nThe Guadalupe Project is located approximately 120 km by road from Medellin, the\ncapital city of the Department of Antioquia, which has a population of approximately\n3,500,000 in its metropolitan area. Medellin is serviced by several daily flights from\nBogota as well as international destination including Miami, New York, Lima, Caracas,\nQuito, and Panama City. The drive to the town of Guadalupe takes approximately 2.5\nhours. The property can be reached by driving north from Medellin along the main\ndivided, multi-lane highway to a point approximately 7 km south of the town of Barbosa.\nFrom there, secondary paved roads through the towns of Barbosa, Gomez Plata, and\nCarolina del Principe lead to the town of Guadalupe. Access within the project area is by\ndirt roads, foot paths, and horse trails.\n\n\n\nCLIMATE\nThe project lies within the cool temperate moist forest zone of the Holdridge Life Zone\nclassification. The climate in the region varies with altitude. In the town of Guadalupe\n(1875 MASL), the average temperature is 20\u00b0C. Two rainy seasons occur, from October\nto November and from April to May. The average annual precipitation in the region is\nvariable depending on location but can be greater than 2,000 mm. Exploration activities\ncan be conducted year round.\n\n\n\nLOCAL RESOURCES\nLimited services are available in the town of Guadalupe, a town located in the central\nportion of the project area, including temporary accommodations, emergency health\nservices, fuel, and unskilled labour. Guadalupe has daily bus service to Medellin.\nAccording to the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) census\nof 2005, Guadalupe had a population of 6,191. A greater range of services are available\nin Medellin. Any mining development on the property would have access to hydroelectric\npower from the national transmission grid. Sufficient water for any mining operation can\nbe readily developed.\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                Page 5-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                       www.scottwilson.com\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\nSecondary paved and gravel roads provide access locally within the project area.\nHydroelectric plants have been developed along the Porce and Guadalupe Rivers and\nhigh tension power lines cross the property. An abandoned railway line occurs about 10\nkm south of the property.\n\n\n\nPHYSIOGRAPHY\nThe property is located in steep, mountainous and relatively rugged terrain at elevations\nbetween 900 m to greater than 2,000 MASL in the northern portion of the Central\nCordillera.\n\n\nHydroelectric power generation, agriculture (including coffee and sugarcane), and\nlivestock grazing are the principal economic activities in the area.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                   Page 5-2\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n\n\n6 HISTORY\nColombia was once the largest gold producer in the Spanish Empire. Gold production\nfrom Colombia for the period of 1514 to 1934 is estimated at 49 million ounces. Two-\nthirds of this production was from placer deposits. Subsequent production is estimated at\n30 million ounces. Three-quarters of this production is reported to have come from the\ndepartments of Antioquia and Caldas.\n\n\nAlthough small scale operations have taken place over the years on various licences\ncomprising the Guadalupe Project, record of this production is poorly documented.\n\n\nScott Wilson RPA is not aware of any documentation related to exploration activities,\nincluding diamond drilling, available for any of the subject licences prior to 2008.\n\n\n\nGRUPO DE BULLET S.A.\nIn 2009, Bullet undertook a property wide prospecting program designed to rapidly\nidentify target areas with potential for near surface gold and/or copper deposits. The\nprogram consisted of rock and float sampling at locations considered to be of interest. A\ntotal of 60 sites were sampled. In addition, 107 pan concentrates were collected with the\naim of rapidly recognizing areas with higher potential for gold mineralization. Of these,\n42 gave positive results. A total of three active underground mines, five active alluvial\noperations, and 46 abandoned mines were identified and geo-referenced (O\u2019Prey,\n2009).\n\n\nBased on the results of Bullet\u2019s 2009 work, three principal target areas were identified.\nThe following is summarized from O\u2019Prey (2009).\n\n\nEL HOYO\nThe El Hoyo target area covers an 8 km long, north to northeast trending area hosted in\nthe Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary sequence near the contact with the Antioquia\nBatholith. Three distinct centres within the El Hoyo target area have been identified, two\nof which occur on licences comprising the Guadalupe Project. From south to north,\nthese two are:\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                    Page 6-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\n   \u2022   Petronilla Mine area: This mine is reported to have over 2 km of underground\n       workings, however, only 80 m of workings are currently accessible. Bullet\u2019s\n       sampling yielded results of up to 10.45 g/t Au, 18 g/t Ag, and 2.28% Sb over 0.4\n       m as well as 5.74 g/t Au, 8.79 g/t Ag, and 2.01% Sb over 1.0 m. It is difficult to\n       distinguish clear mineralizing structures in the mine, rather the altered, green,\n       sheered, porphyritic host rock appears to be cut by quartz and antimony veins up\n       to 5 cm wide and sulphide rich veinlets, typically trending 190\u00b0/60\u00b0.\n\n   \u2022   The Malabrigo area: Located at the northern end of the El Hoyo area, this area is\n       presently defined by the occurrence of a number of float and outcrop samples.\n       Two inactive underground mines were located and one was sampled, returning\n       1.44 g/t Au, 7.87 g/t Ag, and 170 ppm Sb from a grab sample. Two other float\n       samples were also taken in the area that returned 0.80 g/t Au, 1.29 g/t Ag, and\n       38 ppm Sb and 0.83 g/t Au, 39 g/t Ag, and 2,065 ppm Sb. The typical outcrop in\n       the area is a dark basalt, however, this can be intensely altered to the point of\n       losing all original structure and producing fine pyrite clusters and kaolin.\n       Evidence of stockworking was also seen in the float, as well as a number of\n       quartz-pyrite veins up to 10 cm wide.\n\nCASCAJEROS\nThe Cascajeros target area is located west of the town of Guadalupe and is underlain by\nthe Cretaceous aged Antioquia Batholith. It is characterized by a group of small, mostly\nabandoned underground workings as well as La Esperanza mine, which had been\ndeveloped over 45 m in a generally north-south direction. Typically these abandoned\nmines contain quartz veins less than 20 cm wide and sampling completed by the\ncompany showed only anomalous levels of gold mineralization.\n\n\nLa Esperanza mine is developed along a 50 cm wide quartz vein that returned 42.9 g/t\nAu. Gold mineralization was encountered in the footwall, related to a narrow dike were a\none metre sample returned 10.1 g/t Au.\n\n\nIn addition, a large anomalous area has been defined by gold in pan concentrate results\nthat highlight the area as meriting significant follow-up work.\n\n\nSAN JUAN\nThe San Juan target area is located north of the town of Guadalupe and is the\ngeologically least understood of the three principal target areas. It is defined by the north\nflowing San Juan River and its surrounding tributaries. This area has returned\nanomalous results for precious metals as well as for copper and zinc.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                    Page 6-2\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                  www.scottwilson.com\n\nThe San Juan area is dominated by basalts and arenites of the San Pablo Formation,\nalthough its western contact is the Antioquia Batholith and there are a number of\nmapped acid-intermediate igneous intrusions within the area which suggest a complex\ngeological history. The most obvious feature of the area is the amount of alluvial gold,\nseen either in the pan or as a result of significant alluvial workings that have been\nconducted or continue to be conducted along the terraces of the main drainages. This is\nparticularly true in the San Basilio, San Vicente, and Santa Teresa drainages.\n\n\nIn addition to the areas of interest defined by alluvial gold, at least three zones with\nanomalous rock/float results have been defined. The first two of these relate to the San\nBasilio/San Vicente alluvial anomalies and returned results up to 4.52 g/t Au and 5.21%\nZn in a float sample and 0.46 g/t Au in a grab sample of vein material from a 20 cm wide\naltered and fractured zone, hosted in basalt. The float sample was composed of quartz,\npyrite, and massive sphalerite. A number of abandoned underground workings are\nlocated around the sample suggesting that the source is close by. The third zone is\nunrelated to the alluvial gold anomalies and is located further south in the upper reaches\nof the San Juan River. An altered and mineralized zone with sulphides and oxides\ngiving a yellow colour was encountered on the river\u2019s edge and two samples returned up\nto 0.46 g/t Au, 10 g/t Ag, and 47.6 ppm Sb.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                   Page 6-3\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n\n\n7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING\nREGIONAL GEOLOGY\nThe Colombian Cordillera comprises three separate mountain ranges underlain by a\nseries of magmatic arcs that were emplaced along the western margin of South America\nfrom Jurassic through Miocene time. Subduction along an Andean-type continental\nmargin during the Jurassic gave way to accretion of allochthonous island-arc terranes in\nthe Cretaceous and Tertiary. The predominantly calc-alkaline affinity of the subduction-\nrelated magmatism throughout this period coupled with the complex poly-phase\ncompressional structural regime created a favourable metallogenic setting for economic\ngold and copper deposits. The project is located at the northernmost end of the Central\nCordillera.

(2009).\n\n\nThe geology of the Guadalupe region is dominated by the regional contact between the\nMiddle to Upper Cretaceous-aged Antioquia Batholith to the south and a mixed series of\nmetamorphic, sedimentary, and volcanic rocks ranging from Paleozoic through\nCretaceous age to the north. The intercalated metamorphic and volcano-sedimentary\n(San Pablo Formation) sequences are arranged in broadly north-south striking belts,\nextending northwards from this roughly east-west striking contact. Contacts within the\nCretaceous-aged volcano-sedimentary sequence are considered conformable, whilst\nthose separating Cretaceous strata from the Paleozoic amphibolite grade metamorphic\nrocks are fault interpreted. Sill-like gabbro through peridotite bodies within the mafic\nportions of the volcano-sedimentary San Pablo Formation suggest ophiolite affinities.\nAdditional late granitoid \u201ccataclastic\u201d dikes within the volcano-sedimentary sequence are\nlikely related to the emplacement of the Antioquia Batholith.\n\n\nThe San Pablo Formation has been divided into two units. The volcanic dominated\n\u201cMetabasalt\u201d unit is considered slightly older and is composed mostly of massive flows\nand submarine basalts with lesser amounts of flow breccias and tuffs. All have suffered\ngreat tectonism, which in part masks regional metamorphic effects. The upper part of the\nunit is interbedded with a clastic sedimentary sequence dominated by a fine to medium\ngrained quartz arenite facies and a less important conglomerate facies, interbedded with\nquartz arenites. Contact metamorphism as a result of the intrusion of the Antioquia\nBatholith has produced a hornsfelsing of the arenitic facies. In summary, the San Pablo\nFormation is considered to represent \u201cflysch\u201d deposits in geosynclines in coastal basins.\n\n\nThe Antioquia Batholith is a large, typically acid to intermediate intrusive body that\ndominates the Central Cordillera of Antioquia. Typically granodioritic in composition, it\nincludes a number of more local variants and its overall genesis is still poorly\nunderstood, as is its role in the formation of gold mineralizing systems.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                 Page 7-4\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                www.scottwilson.com\n\nPROPERTY GEOLOGY\nThe project area is characterized by a significant thickness of saprolite and colluvial\ncover which combine to mask the property geology.

series of\nmetamorphic, sedimentary, and volcanic rocks ranging from Paleozoic through to\nCretaceous age, in the north. Mineralization within the Antioquia Batholith is thought to\nbelong to the \u201cIntrusion Related\u201d gold deposit type. There appears to be a marked\nregional zonation pattern with respect to the proximity to the contact with the Antioquia\nBatholith. This zonation includes the proximal Au dominated mesothermal veins, grading\noutwards (northwards) through Cu (Mo-Au-Ag-Zn) to Pb-Zn and to Zn-Sb-Ag dominated\nmineralization (Shaw, 1999).\n\n\n\nINTRUSION RELATED GOLD DEPOSITS\nIntrusion related gold systems (IRGS) are a relatively newly defined deposit\nclassification. Intrusion related gold deposits refer to a group of deposits with wide\nranging characteristics, granitoid associations, and tectonic settings. The most coherent\nclassification is for reduced IRGS. The following is taken from Hart (2005).\n\n\nThe characteristics of reduced IRGS are listed below:\n\n\n   1. Metaluminous, sub-alkalic intrusion of intermediate to felsic compositions that lie\n      near the boundary between ilmenite and magnetite series;\n\n   2. Carbonic hydrothermal fluids;\n\n   3. A metal assemblage that variably combines gold with elevated Bi, W, As, Mo, Te\n      and/or Sb and low concentrations of base metals;\n\n   4.

They are mostly designed to\ndifferentiate intrusion related gold deposits, which are a product of local scale fluids\nderived from a cooling pluton, from orogenic deposits that are considered to result from\ncrustal scale fluids derived through metamorphic dehydration. Some features exclusively\ndifferentiate reduced IRGS. No single characteristic is diagnostic, but a suite of features\nis most effective to provide evidence for intrusion related origin.\n\n\nTECTONIC SETTING\nReduced IRGS deposits are best developed in intrusions that were emplaced into\nancient continental margins behind accretionary or collisional orogens and subduction\nrelated magmatic arcs. Preferred host strata include reducing basinal miogeoclinal\nsedimentary or metasedimentary rocks.\n\n\nMETAL ZONING\nThermal gradients surrounding cooling plutons are steep and result in temperature\ndependent concentric metal zones that develop outward from pluton margins for\ndistances up to a few kilometres, or just beyond the thermal aureole. Pluton proximal\ngold mineralization may be associated with Be, Te, and W aureole-hosted mineralization\nwill have an As or Sb tenor, and distal mineralization may be related to Ag-Pb-Zn.\n\n\nDIVERSE DEPOSITS\nFluids exsolving from cooling plutons are opportunistic and cool quickly, thus depositing\nmetals in several available geological settings. Resulting mineralization is commonly of\nseveral different styles: variably intrusion and country-rock hosted consisting of skarns,\nreplacements,      disseminations,   stockworks,   and    veins.      Gold   mineralization   is\ncharacterized by a wide range of gold grades, with bulk mineable volumes present at the\n0.8 g/t to 1.5 g/t level.\n\n\nSHEETED VEINS\nThe most distinctive style of gold mineralization in reduced IRGS are sheeted arrays of\nparallel, low-sulphide, single-stage quartz veins which are found over tens to hundreds\nof metres and preferentially located in the pluton\u2019s cupola. These veins are unlike\nmultidirectional interconnected stockworks characteristic of porphyry systems or\nantithetic tensional vein arrays typical of orogenic deposits.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                       Page 8-2\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\nPLUTON FEATURES\nMineralizing plutons have \u201csmoking gun\u201d characteristics that indicate the likelihood of\ngeneration of hydrothermal fluids. Physical features and geochemical support should\nexist for high volatile contents, fluid exsolution, evidence of rapid fractionation, zoned\nplutons, porphyry textures, presence of aplite and pegmatite dykes, quartz and\ntourmaline veins, greisen alteration, miarolitic cavities and/or unidirectional-solidification\ntextures, preferably in the pluton\u2019s apices.\n\n\nREDOX STATE\nReduced IRGS are associated with felsic, ilmenite-series plutons that lack magnetite,\nhave low magnetic susceptibilities and aeromagnetic response, and have low\nferric:ferrous ratios of less than 0.3. These types of plutons are uncommon in arc and\nfore arc settings where orogenic gold deposits are most common.\n\n\nTIMING\nIntrusion related deposits are coeval (\u00b1 2 m.y.) with their associated, causative pluton.\n\n\n\nMESOTHERMAL VEINING\nMesothermal veins occur in rock packages of Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic\nage, commonly hosted in metamorphosed mafic volcanic flows (greenstone-hosted type)\nand sedimentary rocks (slate-belt or turbidite-hosted type). In other cases, the veins are\nlocated within the contact aureole of granitic intrusions in various host rocks. Gold\nmineralization can have a variety of forms and may occur in shear zones, discordant\nquartz veins or quartz-vein sets (e.g., stockworks) as well as stratabound zones.\nAlthough free gold does occur in quartz veins in some deposits, much of the gold occurs\nin association with pyrite and/or arsenopyrite in the altered wallrocks surrounding the\nveins.\n\n\nMesothermal vein deposits are structurally controlled, complex epigenetic deposits that\nare hosted in deformed and metamorphosed terranes. They consist of simple to complex\nnetworks of gold-bearing, laminated quartz-carbonate fault-fill veins in moderately to\nsteeply dipping, compressional brittle-ductile shear zones and faults, with locally\nassociated extensional veins and hydrothermal breccias. They are dominantly hosted by\nmafic metamorphic rocks of greenschist to locally lower amphibolite facies and formed at\nintermediate depths (5 km to 10 km). Greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                     Page 8-3\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                www.scottwilson.com\n\nare typically associated with iron-carbonate alteration. The relative timing of\nmineralization is syn- to late-deformation and typically post-peak greenschist-facies or\nsyn-peak amphibolite-facies metamorphism. They are formed from low salinity, H2O-\nCO2-rich hydrothermal fluids with typically anomalous concentrations of CH4, N2, K, and\nS. Gold is mainly confined to the quartz-carbonate vein networks but may also be\npresent in significant amounts within iron-rich sulphidized wall rock. Greenstone-hosted\nquartz-carbonate vein deposits are distributed along major compressional to\ntranspressional crustal-scale fault zones in deformed greenstone terranes of all ages,\nbut are more abundant and significant, in terms of total gold content, in Archean\nterranes. However, a significant number of world-class deposits (>100 t Au) are also\nfound in Proterozoic and Paleozoic terranes (Dub\u00e9 and Gosselin, 2006).\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                Page 8-4\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                               www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n9 MINERALIZATION\nTo date, mineralization on the Guadalupe Project has been restricted to local small-\nscale, hand mining of narrow veins and shears, mainly for gold.

A total of eight samples were collected from the El Hoyo,\nQuebrada El Arroyo, Los Chorros, and the Cascajeros areas. Table 10-1 lists the Au,\nAg, and Cu results from Norvista\u2019s sampling.\n\n\nNorvista\u2019s samples were submitted to SGS\u2019 facility in Medellin for sample preparation\nfollowed by analysis in SGS\u2019 Lima, Peru laboratory. Gold was analyzed by fire assay\nfollowed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) finish on a 30 g charge (SGS\nlab code FAA313). The samples were also analyzed by inductively coupled plasma\natomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass\nspectroscopy (ICP-MS) for a suite of 49 elements after a four acid digestion (SGS lab\ncode ICM40B).\n\n\n                           TABLE 10-1 NORVISTA SAMPLING\n                       Solvista Gold Corporation - Guadalupe Project\n\n  Licence           Area           Sample      Easting     Northing    Au      Ag         Cu\n                                     No.                              (ppm)   (ppm)   (ppm)\n ANT-7509    Quebrada Azufral       1942          874679   1247455    0.115   5.83    >10,000\n ANT-7509    Quebrada El Arroyo     1943          874606   1246976    0.149   7.47     8,392\n    N/A      Traversias             1945          871839   1245670    0.331   0.86     375.2\n ANT-6300    Los Chorros            1946          871897   1245174    0.248   3.82     48.4\n ANT-7509    El Hoyo                1947          872869   1247001    0.22    221      1.46\n ANT-7509    El Hoyo                1948          872892   1246969    0.48     48      71.2\n ANT-7509    El Hoyo                1949          872059   1246521    0.009   0.82     71.2\n ANT-6300    Cascajeros             1950          870770   1245732    0.002   0.08     3.74\n\n\n\nAIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS\nSolvista Gold contracted MPX Geophysics Ltd.

The survey flight lines were\noriented at an azimuth of 090\u00b0 and were spaced at 200 m intervals. The tie lines were\nflown at 1,800 m intervals, perpendicular to the flight lines. A total of 829.2 line-km of\nsurveying was flown covering an area of 143.7 km2.\n\n\nGeophysical data acquisition involved the use of precision differential GPS positioning, a\nmulti-channel gamma ray spectrometer system and a high sensitivity magnetometer\ninstalled in a single sensor fixed boom.\n\n\nAs of the effective date of this report, the results of the survey are being processed and\nhave yet to be interpreted. Figures 10-1 and 10-2 illustrate the Total Magnetic Intensity\nand Total Radiometric Count results, respectively.\n\n\n\nPROSPECTING\nFrom late September 2010 to late January 2011, Solvista Gold completed a program of\nsurface prospecting and sampling. Samples consisted mainly of rock chip and channel\nsamples taken to confirm areas of known mineralization and to follow up areas of\ninterest. A total of 95 samples, including standards, blanks and duplicates, have been\nsent for analyses. The analytical protocols for these samples mimic those of Norvista\u2019s\nNovember 2009 sampling outlined above. As of the effective date of this report, Solvista\nGold has only received the analytical results of 52 samples. Results to date include\nvalues of up to 4.2 g/t Au related to quartz veining in the San Basilio area and of values\nof up to 1.2 g/t Au, 12 g/t Ag and 6.4% Zn related to green basalt hosted semi-massive\nsulphides.\n\n\n\nSOIL SAMPLING\nIn early February 2011, Solvista Gold initiated a test soil sampling program to determine\nthe optimum parameters for a larger scale sampling program.

Geo., Senior Consulting Geologist with Scott Wilson RPA and an\nindependent QP, visited the project from February 16 to 17, 2010. During the visit, he\nexamined outcrops, confirmed the geological setting, and sampled typical mineralized\nstructures from which Norvista, a current shareholder of Solvista Gold, had achieved\nsignificant results in their November 2009 sampling.\n\n\nThe samples consisted of semi-continuous chips taken perpendicular to the strike of the\nmineralized structures. The samples were bagged, tagged, and sealed in a larger rice\nbag and remained in Mr. Chamois\u2019 possession for the trip from the project area to\nMedellin. Mr. Chamois personally delivered the samples to SGS Mineral Services (SGS)\nsample preparation facility in Medellin. The samples were dried, crushed to 75% passing\n2 mm, split to 250 g, and pulverized to 85% passing 75 \u00b5m in Medellin according to\nSGS\u2019 sample preparation lab code PRP89.

The prospect is held by a Colombian national, but Scott Wilson RPA\nunderstands that title to the property is currently being challenged with the mining\nauthority.\n\n\nPrevious work by Minercol (1969 to 1972), Bullet (1997 to 1998), and Noranda (1997 to\n1998) has identified massive to locally laminated (sheared), fine to medium grained\nmineralization consisting of pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and minor bornite hosted by\nhornfelsed Cretaceous sandstone and argillite of the San Pablo Formation. The San\nPablo Formation is in contact with the quartz dioritic Antioquia Batholith immediately to\nthe east of the mineralized outcrops. The mineralization appears to be fault controlled\nand strikes perpendicular to the local and regional geological trend. The mineralization\noccurs in two main areas, namely, the El Azufral and El Arroyo showings. No drilling has\nbeen completed on the showings to date.\n\n\nAt El Azufral, the mineralization strikes at N70\u00b0W and dips vertically. The mineralization\noutcrops over a strike length of over 100 m and is up to 12 m in true thickness, although\nthe fault system that hosts it can be traced for over six kilometres. Sampling indicates\nthat the average grade is in the 2.0% Cu to 2.5% Cu range.\n\n\nAt El Arroyo, located some 500 m south of El Azufral, the mineralization also strikes at\nN70\u00b0W and has been traced over a distance of 20 m. It has a true thickness of up to six\nmetres. The average Cu grade at El Arroyo appears to be less than 2.0%.\n\n\nThere appears to be a marked regional zonation pattern with respect to the proximity to\nthe contact with the Antioquia Batholith. This zonation includes the proximal Au\ndominated mesothermal veins, grading outwards (northwards) through Cu (Mo-Au-Ag-\nZn) to Pb-Zn and to Zn-Sb-Ag dominated mineralization (Shaw, 1999).\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                Page 15-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                      www.scottwilson.com\n\nTable 15-1 lists various estimates of El Azufral\u2019s potential. Given that no drilling has\ntaken place and given the methodology used and assumptions made to generate these\nestimates, particularly by Smith (1998), Scott Wilson RPA does not consider these\nestimates to be valid. These estimates are not reliable as they predate NI 43-101 and\ncannot be verified. Scott Wilson RPA cautions that these historical estimates should not\nbe relied upon.\n\n\n         TABLE 15-1 HISTORIC EL AZUFRAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES\n                         Solvista Gold Corporation - Guadalupe Project\n\n        Deposit                Tonnes      Grade             Category           Estimator\n                                (000)      (% Cu)\nEl Azufral                      500          N/A       \"Reserve\"                MINERCO\nEl Azufral                    495-1,000   2.0-3.0 eq   \"Resource Potential\"    Shaw (1999)\nEl Arroyo                      100-700    2.0-3.0 eq   \"Resource Potential\"    Shaw (1999)\nEl Azufral & El Arroyo         27,186       1.88       \"Resource\"              Smith (1998)\n\n\nLA BRAMADORA\nLa Bramadora mine is located in the northeastern portion of the project area,\napproximately 11 km northeast of the town of Guadalupe and adjacent to Licence 4299.\nHistorically, the mine processed approximately 10 tonnes of ore per day, producing free\nAu and Pb and Zn concentrates as by-products. The mine is reported to have produced\nin the order of 500,000 ounces of gold. The mine is located within the projected reservoir\nof the Porce IV hydroelectric power project and was therefore officially closed in 1996.\nThe mineralization occurs as a northwest striking sub-parallel dyke-stockwork system,\nhosted in quartz-sericite schists, with a wide range of sulphides. At least three different\nstages of mineralization have been identified. Since 1996, La Bramadora has been\nmined informally.\n\n\nScott Wilson RPA has been unable to verify the information relating to the properties\nmentioned above. The information related to these properties is not necessarily\nindicative of the mineralization on Solvista Gold\u2019s Guadalupe Project.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                  Page 15-2\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                         www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n\n\n16 MINERAL PROCESSING AND\nMETALLURGICAL TESTING\nNo mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been done on any mineralized\nsamples from the Guadalupe Project by Solvista Gold.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                       Page 16-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                           www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n17 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL\nRESERVE ESTIMATES\nThere is no current mineral resource or mineral reserve estimate on the Guadalupe\nProject.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                        Page 17-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                 www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n\n\n18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND\nINFORMATION\nSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\nForeign Affairs and International Trade Canada advises against all travel to certain\ndepartments in Colombia including Antioquia. The presence of armed drug traffickers,\nguerrilla, and paramilitary organizations poses a major risk to travellers. These groups\ncontinue to perpetrate attacks, extortion, kidnappings, car bombings, and damage to\ninfrastructure in these areas (www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/report_rapport).\n\n\nScott Wilson RPA did not experience any security issues during the property visit.\n\n\n\nPARAMO ECOSYSTEM\nLaw 1382 of 2010 which reforms the existing Mining Code requires that mining and\nexploration activity must be excluded from the \"Paramo\" ecosystem. Paramo is an\necosystem above 3,200 m elevation consisting of glacier-formed valleys and plains with\nlakes, peat bogs, and wet and dry grasslands intermingled with shrub lands and forest\npatches.\n\n\nAll of the mining titles comprising the Guadalupe Project are located below the Paramo\necosystem and, therefore, are not affected by the new legislation.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                Page 18-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                    www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS\nSolvista Gold has acquired a 100% indirect interest in a large land package in the\nDepartment of Antioquia located along the contact between the Cretaceous-aged,\nsubalkalic Antioquia Batholith to the south and San Pablo Formation, a mixed series of\nmetamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic rocks ranging from Paleozoic through to\nCretaceous age, in the north. The Guadalupe Project is thought to be prospective for\nboth intrusion related gold deposits and mesothermal vein-style deposits. This area has\nnot had the benefit of a systematic exploration program using modern techniques.\n\n\nA property wide prospecting program designed to rapidly identify target areas with the\npotential for near surface gold and/or copper deposits was undertaken by a subsidiary of\na shareholder of Solvista Gold, Grupo de Bullet S.A., in 2009. Based on the results of\nrock and float samples, Bullet identified three principal targets areas for follow-up work.\n\n\nTo date, mineralization on the Guadalupe Project has been restricted to local small-\nscale, hand mining of narrow veins and shears, mainly for gold. Production figures from\nthese efforts are not available.\n\n\nScott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Solvista Gold\u2019s Guadalupe Project is an early\nstage exploration property with good potential to host significant mineralization and\nwarrants a systematic exploration effort.\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                   Page 19-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                   www.scottwilson.com\n\n\n20 RECOMMENDATIONS\nScott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Solvista Gold\u2019s Guadalupe Project is an attractive\nearly stage exploration property and merits a significant exploration program.\nRecommended Phase I work, beginning as soon as operationally practical, includes:\n\n\n   \u2022   the acquisition of satellite imagery and a digital elevation model,\n   \u2022   a property wide geological mapping and sampling program, and,\n   \u2022   the interpretation of the combined airborne magnetic, electromagnetic, and\n       radiometric survey.\n\n\nThe proposed Phase I work should not require environmental permitting. All proposed\nPhase I field work should be able to be completed using hand-held GPS instruments and\nshould not require cutting a grid.\n\n\nDetails of the recommended Phase I exploration program, envisioned to begin in early\n2011 and to take six months to complete, can be found in Table 20-1.\n\n\n                  TABLE 20-1 PROPOSED BUDGET - PHASE I\n                    Solvista Gold Corporation - Guadalupe Project\n\n                                     Item                         US$\n                Head Office Services                              25,000\n                Project Management/Staff Cost                     50,000\n                Expense Account/Travel Costs                      25,000\n                Holding & Option Costs                          175,000\n                Satellite Imagery & Digital Elevation Model       40,000\n                Geology - Mapping & Sampling                      40,000\n                Geophysical Consulting                            25,000\n                Field Labour                                      25,000\n                Analyses (including shipping)                     25,000\n                Accommodations/Camp Costs                         25,000\n                Security & Social                                 25,000\n                Transportation & Communications                  25,000\n                Subtotal                                        505,000\n                Contingency                                       50,000\n                TOTAL                                           555,000\n\n\n\n\n Solvista Gold Corporation \u2013 Guadalupe Project                                Page 20-1\n Technical Report NI 43-101 \u2013 February 28, 2011\n\f", "SCOTT WILSON RPA                                                   www.scottwilson.com\n\nContingent upon the Phase I program results, a recommended Phase II program,\nenvisioned to begin in early 2011, consists of:\n\n\n   \u2022   establishing cut grids over airborne geophysical or geological targets where\n       Phase I stream sediment sampling has identified anomalous areas,\n   \u2022   soil sampling and detailed geological mapping and sampling over the grids, and,\n   \u2022   detailed IP/resistivity surveying over anomalous areas.\n\n\nGrids should be established with 100 m spaced lines.
